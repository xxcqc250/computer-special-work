loved the taipei zoo - money value is unbeatable
animals live in clean and modern compounds
we loved the butterfly house with all kinds of beautiful butterflies flying around
we even took a picture with a butterfly that decided to land on my head
great experience


easy to get to from anywhere in taipei and very cheap to get in, (60nt?)
huge variety of animals to see, easy to walk, and very clean too
watch out for the 'free range' spiders out there, though! take a ride on the mao kong gondola afterwards



ok, it was a hot day but all the animals looked hot and tired, and bored
most of them were lying in the shade or just sitting and staring at something
i'm not a fan of zoo's and this just confirmed it
agree with someone else who said it's sad to see animals cooped up, much rather see them in their natural habitat
won't be visiting another zoo after this
sorry to anyone who works there, i know you're doing your best!


a amazing place for visiting with kids, there are lot of lovely animals that you can see and feel them in a very close distance



we came here for the panda but we were disappointed
the pandas are caged as expected but guests were only allowed to pass by the pandas
we were not even allowed to stay and take just a few photos
the line must keep on going so it felt like we just passed by them
you need to line up again if you want a second view



the taipei zoo is very foreigner friendly
anyone who has a general idea of how to travel on the mrt can go enjoy this spot without much hassle at all
the zoo is really interesting as far as zoos go, there are some regional exhibits that have some very unique animals to taiwan and this should appeal to foreigners' need for something different
it is also quite interesting to see how "western" wildlife is presented
overall, the zoo can take most of a day and is not overly expensive
if you have spent the day and need a meal before going home, try taking the cable cars up the mountain and having dinner at one of the places overlooking the city
the view is fantastic and is an excellent end to the day



i went to this zoo but did not enjoy it since i felt the animals were in too cramped quarters
it made me feel sad so i did not stay too long but the grounds are beautifully kept



i have been before to this zoo and still find it the best
i enjoyed the avery this time
there are so many different birds and it is very clever how you do not feel you are inside of the nets
you can see the animals very clearly and the tigers and leopard wires seem to disappear on your photos
easy to get around
lots of drink machines, and toilets
well signposted although there was some new building sites
while we were there
easy to get to from the mrt or from the gondola station
the new transfer bus is better as it can carry more people and cuts down on the waiting time
can get busy with school parties and at weekends but easy to find quiet places good value day out



a great zoo , easy to reach via the simple to navigate mrt system
not too expensive and an awesome collection of animals
take your patience on the weekends, like any metro zoo it does get crowded



the taipei zoo is a nice day trip activity for those on a budget
entrance fee is 60ntd (~$2) and the zoo is very large
there's also a lot of exhibits and activities to do in the zoo for all age groups
i think the zoo is worth a visit just to see the pandas and koalas, as zoos back home for me don't have them
just make sure to not throw the piece of paper with your admission (if you can't read chinese), as that paper is your ticket into the panda exhibition
my only complaint is that you don't have much time to see the pandas, as the exhibition is set up in a single file so you have to keep the line moving
it doesn't give you much time to see the pandas and read about them, which is disappointing
the zoo is accessible through the mrt (taipei zoo) and it takes you right in front of the zoo
the zoo is also near the maokong gondola entrance, so you can definitely make coming here a day trip
the zoo opens early which is a plus, as i found places in taipei to open fairly late
to get around the zoo, you have the option of taking a shuttle that drops you off at certain exhibits
if you need a break from walking or plan to visit on a hot day, i highly recommend taking the shuttle as it only costs 5ntd each direction and the shuttles come pretty often



we combined the trip to zoo with the maokong gondola
on the way down with the gondola we got off at the taipei zoo south station, and from there we took a nice little shuttle train into the zoo
we did not have a lot of time, but the park and the animals seemed really nice and well kept! we hurried to the pandas, as the were our main goal, and gosh they were cute! although in a cage, they have a lot of space and seem healthy and content



many varieties of animals in spacious settings; the highlights included the pandas, white rhinos and orangutans
entry is 60 ntd or approximately $3 aud
there is plenty to explore in the zoo; do not go too close to closing as the animals feeding time (out of sight) is close to closing



amazing range of wild animals and the price is simply ridiculously cheap, 2us$, the perfect place for a whole day with kids 



this zoo is very huge
there were many animals in the zoo
panda and turtles were cute
i really enjoyed taipei zoo



brought my daughter when she was one and it was not so enjoyable for her as we can hardly see the animals on a hot day
we thought she was too young and brought her again now she is six
it is still so hot, and the animals were all hiding in the shade
there was not much fun for the kids, we left in an hour



the taipei zoo is one of the best zoo's in asia
the collection of animals is world class and the zoo is constantly working to make sure the environment is updated (albeit slowly)
for $80twd admission adult, you can't beat the price, it's easy to access through the metro system and is next to the maokong gondola which is another great taipei attraction
here's what you need to know:- plan to visit the zoo when the weather is cool unless you really enjoy sweating
the zoo environment is something close to jurassic world
if you choose your dates correctly, you can really have a pleasant experience weather wise
- unless you enjoy endless lines and being with about a million other people trying to see the same things, definitely go on a weekday when school is in session and there are no public holidays
you will have a much better chance of enjoying the attractions without being crowded
- eat before you come - the only food at the zoo is a mcdonald's at the front gate
there are plenty of great restaurants and eateries in taipei well worth your time
don't waste your food money at the zoo
but there is an all present 7-11 inside the gate also for water and snacks
(so convenient)signage is all bi-lingual, so you won't have much trouble getting around
i hope you enjoy it



living conditions for all animals except birds and maybe those formosan species are really terrible
if you like animals, don't go there, otherwise seeing their pity lives there will make you really sad!


we really did not know what to expect from this zoo, as the ticket is only 2 usd per adult
however, we were pleasantly surprised
while the zoo feels a bit unorganized and packed with people, the animals enclosures looks fine and the animals seem happy
there's a lot of walking involved in the huge zoo, some of which are a bit up hill, so bring your walking shoes
the panda enclosure is particularly nice and popular
give yourself at least 3 hours to fully explore the zoo



i can see the animals and can have a good time with my family
i wish tomorrow isn't that hot because i'm going back again with my granddad
i'm excited! also
i can go and there is lots of delicious cafe



should you come here, i would suggest you to come early
the zoo is well marked, and it's not difficult for you to get your way around the place
there's a convenience store in there and towards lunch time, you would be one of the people that congregate the store like animals that are drawn to the pond for water in the safari park
all the popular animals are there and the children in particular would have a ball
taipei is a concrete jungle and from time to time, this is a nice place to come to, to be surrounded by green for a change
commendable visit


the best zoo intima
great facility and setup
diversities of the spices is also impressive, you will see the panda from china, koala from australia, camel from sahara dessert, elephant for tailand, pengeon from south pole


etc
you have to go there!!!


this zoo was well set out with lots of places to sit and rest
lots of great animals to see of course
awesome breastfeeding rooms and change facilities
make sure you take your bug spray as the sandflies/midges were fierce!


it's beautiful and you are up close to the animals
the animals have so much space to play
they have pandas, koala, jaguars bears and so much more
it takes all day to do the whole zoo park



having kids ages 6-10, visiting a zoo just seem like a must do every city we visit
this has to be one of the better ones we've seen
yes, they are all caged and fenced
but unlike most places where animals just seem unhappy, these are animated, not shy or annoyed to be seem
perfect example is the main attraction, panda
of all the zoos with panda, this is the only one with pandas that genuinely seem happy and don't mind the captivity
pros: huge variety from all over the world, cheap ($2 us/person)cons: dated, some construction (ongoing since at least 2015), some areas need repair, not well signed and somewhat of a weird flow of traffic, children discount not applicable to non-taiwan citizens, limited seating for diningtip: during warm season use various exhibit halls (panda, reptile, insects, penguin) to cool off
ac is hardly ever weak in taiwan



large garden with large variety of animals
very cheap entrance fee
having both panda's big and red and they were moving and eating when we got there
the time for big panda visit is limited
expect crowds when visiting afternoon



the taipei zoo is much bigger than i expected
it took me 3
5 hours to visit the zoo going at a fast pace
plan 3-4 hours if you want to see everything
you can come here in the morning and visit maokong tea plantations in the afternoon
the price of the zoo is cheap and restaurants are reasonable priced, they don't cheat you like many other zoos will
the zoo is well-organized and filled with animals from all over the world
it is near the metro as well so it is easy to reach



variety and size are two things the taipei zoo has going for it
aim to arrive when the zoo opens at 9am because the crowds start spilling in from late morning
remember to collect a queue coupon to see the pandas at the main entrance (tip: staff at the panda enclosure didn't seem to care that we were turning up an hour earlier than the time stated on our panda coupon)
a good strategy to visit all the animals is to walk from the main entrance to the other end and either catch the shuttle train back to the entrance or to the maokong gondola station for nt5
this should take you about an hour if you don't stop or 2
5 hours if you stop to take photos



super affordable fare at only twd60! and we got a chance to visit such a good zoo with so many variety of animals, including panda and penguin at no additional costs!the zoo is nicely organised into sections/areas where animals are well segregated into respective sections/areas
plan the tour/journey as u like it to be
resting areas and convenient shops are located between the sections/areas, don't worry about rest rooms & places to eat & rest :-)recommended to visit during non-holiday seasons
we visited taipei zoo on friday and we got to enjoy observing penguin & panda (those rare and popular animals) without big crowds :-)may consider taking maokong gondola located at just few hundred meters away from taipei zoo mrt station (opposite direction of taipei zoo main entrance)
it brings u up to taipei zoo uphill and walking down the zoo compound would be easier and more relaxing
the transit only costs twd5 :-)the zoo is very big and please spare more than half a day if u really want to visit all sections/areas
but it's definitely worthy!


the zoo is easily accessible via metro taipei
entry prices are very reasonable at nt60 for adults and nt30 for students
a value for money experience indeed!


very cheap admission fee even for tourists
lots of school tours on the day we visit
animals all in good shape and the zoo was well maintained
we had a great time there
they have a large nursing and nappy changing facility near the main entrance for nursing mothers
very well thought out! i wish we have a zoo like this in hk



while all zoos are nice to visit, this one was nicely organised into sections and animals from various countries
felt sad to see the small space given to elephants
really wish them a bigger place



awesome zoo! many great exhibits to see


one of the biggest zoos i've been too
it's a little bigger than the san diego zoo
great experience and is near the gondola!


so, constructive feedback first
when you enter the zoo you are given a 'receipt' that you'll need when entering the panda exhibit
without that i'm sure you'll have challenges entering the exhibit
once inside you walk single file as you approach the panda exhibit
you'll have employees shuffling you along as you cannot stand and stare, you can only see the animal for the short time it takes for you to approach the exhibit, then walk by the exhibit, before you leave the exhibit
so, not the best experience and probably 3 minutes of viewing time
as for the rest of the zoo, it was nice
the animals seem healthy and the exhibits seem large enough
we wanted to see a kangaroo but it wasn't available
and the only sign indicating where it's status was written in chinese! lolthere are quite a few food choices along the way
from ice cream to water to a mcdonalds within the entryway of the zoo, you'll find something to cool you off
while i would normally not recommend this, an umbrella to fend off the noonday sun is totally helpful
don't be shy


take one and a small hand fan as well!great place for kids and those young at heart



i had fun visiting the taipei zoo
it was great seeing the pandas and koalas
they also had some penguin
the zoo is easily accessible via the metro



taipei zoo is one of the better zoos that i've been to and the entry cost is only a mere nt$60 which you can pay with your easycard
it is easily accessible by mrt (take the brown line all the way to the last stop)
you can also visit the maokong gondola in this area as well, a good thing to do after a tired day out in the zoo
the zoo has a lot of animals from all over the world but the main attraction would be the pandas which alone is worth the visit
if you're worried about food, there is a mcdonalds and a local taiwanese food shop near the main entrance
definitely visit this place if you have small kids, they will love it!


pros:- it's easily accessible and near maokong, another noteworthy attraction - really value for $$!!! entry fee was a fraction of that of the singapore zoo's
- they have a large variety of exhibits, and seem to be quite big on education and conservation efforts :-) cons:- some of the enclosures didn't seem big enough for the animals, and some animals seemed listless and lonely (or maybe we caught them on a bad day)


it's nice if u like the non commercial, undeveloped feel
i felt that facilities and animal enclosures could be better maintained though
animals such as panda are kept in buildings and guests are hurried along which made us feel frazzled
having been to the singapore and sydney zoo, this was not so attractive
we felt that more space could have been given to the animals as well



great visit and a lovely place to relax and chill
the zoo is located in the rural area of taipei where is close to nature and tons of greenery
it would take around 3 to 4 hours if you would like to visit all of the spots in the zoo


the zoo is huge! great atmosphere up the hill
that being said it may get tiring to go upslope
u should get the shuttle train upslope first and go down! lots of animals to see
take note that some section will be closed on a particular day every month so better check up online to avoid disappointment
also there are no animal shows compared to other zoos


or i didn't realised it
food outlet also limited
so pack your lunch! overall great experience



not far from taipei
easily reachable by subway, taxi/uber, or bus
there is a 7-11 inside as well as a mcdonald's
entry is only nt$60 which is currently less than us$2



we took our 7 year old son to visit the zoo in the morning and had a great time especially watching the monkeys and reptiles
the panda was great to see but looked fairly distressed pacing around its indoor concrete enclosure
we combined travelling on maokong gondola by catching the zoo train to the gondola station at the zoo
good value


i have not been to taipei zoo in a while, but i was surprised
the zoo is huge, with animals from all over the world, including lions, tigers, chimpanzees, gorillas, etc
the highlight of the zoo is seeing the giant pandas
as a kid, i loved visiting zoos, but have never had the chance to see giant pandas in a zoo
taipei zoo was my first chance to do so and i felt it was well worth it
another thing that i found very interesting was how close the animals were
i have never been to another zoo where i could get as up close and personal with the animals as i could at the taipei zoo
if you are visiting taipei, i would consider going to the zoo as one of the top attractions



good with mixed feeling
they close at 5pm
too early when its still bright! especially koala n panda
beside, only few animal in each part
i have to wait a long time to see a bengal tiger


taipei zoo is a great way to spend time with your kids
they have trams to tour around if you are too tires to walk, they have adequate drinking stations
change diaper area, nad rest area
too bad, when we visited it was too warm for our infant baby, as there was a heat wave intaipei on a november visit
taipei zoo- 2 thumbs upvery affordablenice souvenir shopgreat animal


are you travelling with kids than this is a must visit
kids love it and elders too
you need a whole day to finish up
it's big so try to be early in the morning
long lines for panda
some cages are empty when i visited two months back but still worth to visit



for the price, it is hard to find a better zoo
you can get closer to the animals than at many other zoos, and there are a wide variety of animals to see here
we were also able to watch the feeding of some animals as well, which was interesting for us to watch
however, some of the exhibits are dated, and some appear to be in need of updating or remodeling
they seem to be working on this, though -- a large exhibit area of the zoo was closed when i went (though there was still plenty to see), and the panda exhibit is brand new
overall, though, considering the cost, it's a worthwhile activity if you like animals
shade is limited along many paths in the zoo, so i suggest bringing sunscreen and covering up if it's sunny outside



i went to this zoo three times with diff group peoples
suitable for friends, couple and family
the zoo covers a huge area and it will take the better part of a day to walk the entire zoo
the panda is very cute, penguin, bird and butterfly exhibits were really nice
lots of fun things to do for the little ones as well
starting from the main gate you will be walking uphill as you move through the zoo, and at the end there will be carts that will take you all the way back down if you are too exhausted to hike back down on foot
you can take the train tooyou can ride the gondola to top of the zoo and make your way down hill towards the gate


even on a wet day, the zoo was a fun place to visit
the animals seemed content (or as content as they could be in captivity) and there was a good variety of species to see
the pandas even came out to play for a bit in the rain!it's easy to get to using the metro and simple to get around the zoo
it was perhaps larger than we anticipated, so we spent a lot of time walking around in order to get from place to place



you wouldn't imagine someone saying that a zoo is value for money but at 60twd for adult entry and 5twd for a a ride on the internal shuttle, taipei zoo is the 'cheapest ' zoo i've been to! and not only do you get to see koalas, you get to see pandas, penguins, black bear, etc
definitely worth a visit!


our plan for the day included a trip to the zoo, a visit up the (closed) mekong gondola, finished by an evening trip to taipei 101
 the zoo turned out to be better than expected
the enclosures were of a reasonable size and laid out in a very picturesque way
there was an impressive range of different species and plenty of information in both english and chinese
the panda was the most active i have seen, stimulated by its attempts to capture the bamboo dangled above its head
i believe this exercise was meant to recreate some of the natural foraging techniques a wild panda would require
we spent three hours there and only saw about half of the animals on display
it was very worth the extremely reasonable 100 td entrance fee
the shuttle bus that is currently replacing the mekong gondola departs from outside the zoo every half hour
it is bus b15 heading westwards



the taipei zoo is a lovely zoo
what makes it unique is its natural setting with abundant vegetation - orchids, amazing trees, colorful flowers, ponds


i strongly recommend to spend a few hours at this zoo while in taipei
it is easy to access by mrt (taipei's subway), and very inexpensive (60nt per person)
don't miss the pandas
the bird area is also amazing



this is a very big day and you will need a full day at the zoo if you want to see everything it has to offer
there was only 1 panda that you could see when i went because it is there breeding season
there is a wide variety of animals and they do all look like they are being very well taken care of



i spent a great few hours wandering around this excellent zoo
the entrance fee was low, the facilities were great
lots of animals on show
well worth a visit



a very nice zoo i went for the giant pandas so worth itjust for that ,the grounds are well kept can get crowded on holidays


you can literally spend one day to check this zoo out
it is huge! most of the animals though are either asleep or hiding, maybe it depends on what time you're visiting
check out the pandas too - they are adorbs! best of all, the entrance is only ntd 60



i went with our 2 daughters aged 8 and 11 on a rainy sunday morning after visiting the summit of the maokong gondola and we had a great 2 hours
highlights included riding the safari train twice from top to the mid point and then the mid point to the base, watching the giant pandas happily chewing their bamboo in their extensive play area, enjoying the impromptu acrobatic show put on by yatta the red panda and admiring the lynx who had a smile like a contented chesire cat
other people have commented on how the animals seemed depressed
it's true that the penguins seemed rather comatose and the crocodile was a bit inert but we didn't think they were any worse than animals in other places and certainly the whole zoo seemed very well run
we saw a keeper feeding a red panda and playing with it and they both seemed very happy
if you are planning on doing maokong gondola anyway, it's definitely worth a short detour



entry very convenient if you can get the pass
area is very very large
will need a stroller
many exhibits but insufficient shows
engagement is limited
relatively low cost
60 twd for each adult
chargeable exhibits and tram rides are pretty affordable
pretty long wait to switch to the tram ride to go to the gondola
about 20 minutes
floor is a little slippery after rain
toilets are clean
adequate children's facilities



we wanted to visit the zoo as it had been recommended
but once you worked your way into the zoo it looked very rundown in a lot of places
they seem to be doing some renovations, but it seems slow and not enough
we also (compared to other zoos we have visited) thought the animals didn't look well fed or cared for, even the elephants looked skinny
i don't think we saw one zoo keeper in our whole trip who was interacting with an animal, which we found unusual, as this is something you see at all other zoos!


my kids are panda fans and they've been wanting to see some for years so of course we had to visit the zoo but my gosh what a disappointment! there are 2 giant pandas enclosed in a horrible dark indoor space lighted with dim florescent bulbs behind a thick glass wall
they might as well have been stuffed animals because they didn't move an inch
i left feeling deeply sorry for those miserable pandas who would probably have prefered extinction to this kind of depressing existence



zoos are an awful concept
but this one more depressing than any i've ever been to
animals that i did see all looked depressed
including elephant facing a wall swaying backwards and forwards
pandas sleeping in corners
it was weird and not something i'll ever do again
zoos are awful
don't go



my 3 kids and i couldn't get over how many animals this zoo had to offer
they are sectioned off by regions of the world
there's a cable car that can take guest from one side of the park to the other



good place to spend 2/3 hours when in taipei
great range of animals kept in good open spaces
zoo is rebuilding some enclosures to give animals more space and modern facilities
highlights include the pair of giant pandas, lots of african animals, a collection of local animals from "formosa" and the penguins
good tip is to ride the train to the far end of the zoo and walk back
cost 5nt$
for food, there is a mcdonald's inside the zoo which most people use
we visited on a quiet, wet friday so queues not a problem
the popular attractions usually have big queues at weekends



a very nice zoo
nice open habitats to view the animals and surprisingly large variety of animals
not a lot of shade so avoid going on very hot days
location nears mrt stop


extremely large zoo that was well-maintained and very clean
the entrance fee was only ntd$60, which is probably the cheapest anywhere for a zoo of this standard (except for the free smithsonian national zoo in washington dc) 
large variety of animals all in very large enclosures, but the downside of this is that you have to walk, and walk a lot
do take the tram from the panda house to the bird area uphill, and then walk downhill - you will thank me later
we spent 3 hours here and only managed to see about 1/3 of the zoo
not much food variety in the zoo, so you might want to pack a picnic lunch if you're up to it
souvenirs are extremely cheap - none of the mark-ups seen in all the other zoos we have ever visited!definitely worth a visit, especially if you have young children



taipei zoo is a great place to take the kids
it's super easy to get to on the mrt brown line, and the entry price for the zoo is so cheap
nt$60 for adults, nt$30 for kids/students, and free for pre-school kids
it's a very nice zoo, with many beautiful trees
a great way to spend a day or half day
like almost any attraction in taiwan it's best not to go there on a weekend or public holiday because of the crowds



the best part about the zoo was seeing the elephants being very active
other than that, it's a run down facility which makes it a depressing experience overall
the zoo needs some tlc, paint and basic care
it's an ok experience of you walk down through the park from the gondola but if you come in from street level, it's an uphill climb if you don't take the train shuttle



for he price, this is such a great zoo to visit
first time to see penguins!!! loved it espcially for the vast variety of animals





this zoo is a great place to see unusual kinds you will never see in real life
like pandas and orangutan
i was happy to see both
i was sad at the same time that we have to see them in a zoo
living in indonesia i have see orangutan in their natural habitat
visit here if you like animals and hope that they are happier than living in their natural home with us humans destroying their place
the animals look very well looked after though so that is a very good
you can get a bus around the zoo for $ntd 5 which is next to nothing
if its a hot day go and see the penguins, its cooler there, this place is very big so put aside at least 2-3 hours!


very good value for money, we went during a national holiday and it was very crowded but there was still plenty of room for everyone!


on a warm day this is going to be hot
no worries with water since there are a lot of little kiosks that sell refreshments
could use a bit of maintenance on some facilities
the shuttle bus to the gondola was a welcome option
nt$5 to get you there



the zoo have many asian animals and well taken care of
yet the zoo may be a bit "old", as it is going through quite a few renovations in different areas



coming from singapore, i am truly proud of our zoo
before anyone starts slamming me for this, i just wanted to say that since we have an awesome zoo, i have high expectations of the zoos i visit
i am blown away by the entrance fees! it is ridiculously reasonable!i will probably not recommend this for couples, or a group of adults unless you really love animals, or have never seen pandas
else it was really good for the kids and pretty enjoyable for adults as well
worth a half day visit with children
the little area for children is fun too, with chicken roaming around
the low season and cool weather (in december) also helped



paradise for kids
our kids simply loved it even though we missed pandas which are the main attraction here



the zoo has a lot of exhibits but the layout is confusing- especially if it's crowded
there were no english maps
if you get there at lunchtime after doing the gondola don't be suckered into standing in long lines when you walk in the gates to get nasty mcdonalds food
don't make my mistake and get mystery meat buns from the chinese place next to mcdonalds either
start walking through the the park and there are other venues to eat at
people make a big deal at the panda exhibit and because of people standing at the exhibit all day( that's no exaggeration) taking nonstop pictures they have a new system
those little stubs you get handed as you walk in the gate are your panda viewing time chits
there is an outdoor part of the exhibit where said photographers are camped- they are as bad as the people at the cat cafe's with their cameras! anyway get in the line to go inside and hand them your chits as you go in the door
i lost mine and played ignorant foreigner and walked right in without them
you are then instructed to do a brisk walk by of the glass window where people are ogling to get a glimpse of the bear
we went to see the rest of the zoo for a bit but the kids wanted out
too many people staring at them trying to take their pictures- we were the only blondes and possibly the only westerners in the whole joint
lots of animals if you like zoos



it is a big zoo, not so recommended for people that does not like to walk
i think it needs a little more care



it is clean and manicured
in taipei this is good
it is quite informative
check out the info for the camels and zebras
unique and the view over the rhinos is a vantage point we have never seen before
they are waiting for the metal doors to move so they can be fed at five pm this is worth the whole day
the girth on those suckers was incredible
also the lions are ready to eat at the same time so we heard them roaring which was incredible
we have been to san diego zoo and national zoo in washington
the above mentioned uniqueness is worth the visit



the animals are well looked after with large enclosures
we spent 6 hours here walking through the bird aviaries and saw as many animals as possible
the gorilla and hippo enclosures are being redeveloped atm and did not see the gorillas
there are plenty of places to buy snacks and although there were lots of school groups it did not seem overly crowded as there is plenty of open areas and space
the penguins were a highlight



my kids really enjoyed the trip to the zoo, and so did the adults
the big pandas are playful and a delight to watch
the penguins are also another highlight
the zoo has rare animals and they seem to be well taken cared of
it is probably one of the best zoos i have been too
will definitely be back someday
access is easy with the train that goes directly to this
also it is connected to the maokong gondolas which is another highlight



we visited this zoo for taking glimpse of rare & endangered pandas and were delighted to see big, large and cute pandas
1
 while you can visit pandas any time, i recommend you go during the prescheduled show-time slots which are done at regular intervals during the day
we visited during 2
00pm to 2
09pm show during which two large giant pandas entertained the whole crowd with eating, playing , dancing and whole lots of activities with music playing in the background
must see
2
 the zoo has other large animals like penguins, kangaroos, lion, giraffe, rhino, zebra, elephant, camels, birds, crocodiles and many more animals
3
 you can reach the zoo using mrt
taipei zoo is last station on brown line of mrt
4
 for easycard holder no need to stand it queue for zoo entry ticket
suggest after entering the zoo, take a shuttle train and go to the top-end of the zoo (bird station)
from there , keep coming downwards, seeing each & every animals zone and then come to exit
this way you will not get tired
5
 there are various facilities for rest, eating, visiting information, food & drinks
overall a must visit recommendation for visiting rare, endangered giant pandas ! go for it !


i was surprised how cheap it was to enter
the zoo has a dedicated train station which makes access very easy
i've been to a couple of asian zoos and most of the time the conditions are pretty bad, while it's not great a lot of the enclosures have a lot of space for the animals to wander around
additionally some of the enclosures are being update when i went which is good to see
seeing pandas was cool


the taipei zoo situate at mucha
it can take the bus or mrt to here
the zoo area is very big that i have to spend 1~2 hours to stroll
it has not only many animals but also many insects
seeing many cute animals could make me feel happy and relax
i love to go to the taipei zoo,at least go to here once a year
it is a good place to recommend!


was pretty dull and the use of excessive concrete made the zoo looked unflattering and uncomfortable for the animals
in essence, it was a "concrete jungle" with miserable animals
it could be the cold weather that made the place gloomy and uninteresting
the saving grace was the cheap admission fare



very budget friendly, definitely below 5sgd per pax
the panda section was very popular among tourists and locals
other parts of the zoo look run down and quiet to us
families can bus to taipei 101 via green 1 or brown 18 bus after the visit



been to taipei zoo several times
taipei zoo is large, it is recommended to visit every part of it
taipei zoo have a detailed description of the website, to understand the taipei zoo, and then select the portion you want to visit
taipei zoo is suitable for family or friends to go



huge zoo and is budget friendly
you can avail of the shuttle service to get around the humongous zoo



themespandas, birds, pinguines (very funny), big ones, small ones and and andhuge, we walked for hours ;-))entrance fee is very low - cant remember the exact value but very low, paid with easycard !!for pandas you need an add
"voucher" or go there later in the afternoon (then entrance was open and free)cu


i wasn't expecting much from this zoo but i was left in awe! the entrance is less than 2usd and the place is huge! the animals are grouped by area: desert, africa, etc
and it takes around 5h to visit thoroughly
i recommend going there in the morning and then leaving from the gondola taipei zoo south station to take the gondola to the temple in the mountains
when you entrance, they will give you a ticket with a time slot in it
it is to see the pandas



we took a day off from the bustling city of taipei and decided to visit the zoo
first of all the zoo is really big and well organized
all the animals are categorized properly according to the habitat or types and explained clearly
vending machines and kiosks are around the zoo so you don't have to worry about getting drinks or snacks
also there are lockers provided so if you are travelling with your bags you can store your luggage
there is an entrance fee required to enter the zoo but it's really cheap
although the zoo is far away from the city but it is still reachable by the metro so its very convenient
do come earlier in the morning when the weather is cooler
also, exploring the entire app will take at least half of a day, or more if you are reading descriptions or taking photographs
very recommended attraction!


i have visited here many times,i think this is the best zoo in taiwan,the ticket is very cheap and there have a mrt station beside this zoo so the traffic is very conveninence
it is a good place to have fun with my family and my friends



the animals there weren't particularly exotic, so there isn't much to see
was pretty disappointed in general as many animals were asleep eventhough we went in the day



what a great zoo
this must be on everyone's taipei itinerary! the zoo is very affordable and a great value attraction for families
we took the maekong gondola up to the top and had a short wander (wish we had some more time to explore) before taking the ride back down to the zoo
this is one of the better zoos that i have visited and he animals are kept in a good "natural" conditions
great access for viewing for children and adults even when busy
the zoo is nicely planned and spread out, a beautiful environment to walk around
drinks etc very reasonably priced



is well organise, even some places are in construction, but with ntd60, able to view panda, koala bear, penguin is very worth to visit with family and children !


a must go place for outing, especially with young children
animals are well kept n the place is educational
there were a few cages for we human to "put ourselves into the animals' shoes", to try to feel what it's like to be kept in cage as a captured wildlife
the zoo provides abundant information of information for kids and adults as well to learn about the facts of all different animals
a must place for young children!


this is actually a large zoo and the entrancefee of roughly 2 euros is very cheap
they have all the animals you expect and also the koala and the panda! the maekong gondola is just on the right of the zoo
doing both the zoo and the cabelcar can easily take you a full day



i like zoos
and whenever i travel, i try to visit one if the schedule permits
taipei zoo is excellent
the animals look healthy, happy and well kempt
and if they say they have koalas, they sure did! not just one or two, they had a lot! cuteness overload! they also had a pair of pandas here, more cuteness! the zoo lay-out was orderly, liberally interspersed with places to eat, or cool down from the heat, or in our case, seek refuge from the rain
now, this is a zoo!


i enjoyed the zoo very much
it is quite big zoo
feeling proud to see the royal bengal tiger in that zoo



actually i am not fond of zoos because it is hard to find a good one where the animals have enough room for them but this zoo is different
before visiting you should make sure to wake up early and get there as soon as it opens
i went in the early noon and in the end did not have so much time to visit everything
the taipeh zoo lies quiet at the end of the city where the more rural areas start (this was a good choice because this way they have a lot of space) still it is very easy to get there, you just take the "brown" subway to "taipeh zoo" station (terminal stop)
at the front of the zoo you can pay for the tickets which are ridiculously inexpensive (60 twd)
as i said before it is a very huge zoo so make sure you take a map at the entry and if you have forgotten to bring some water you can just buy some snacks and drinks at there as well
the zoo is 95% in an open area and i will not start to list all the animals which i have seen there, most of them of course suited for a tropical climate
the space for each animal species was more than enough and clean
the animals seemed to be well kept/fed
the only thing which i did not like that much was the area with the penguins i thought this had still room for improvement but as for the rest it was all a 10/10
i have been to many zoos but this one is definitely one of my favorite ones
especially if you re traveling with your family (no matter which age) you will make a lot of fun and beautiful memories in the taipeh zoo



very nice zoo, had fun
very cheap entrance ticket
( less than 3 us dollars )
shuttle bus ticket is ( less than 0
50 us dollars )mcdonalds is located at the entrance



this is the best zoo in taiwanhad been other zoo in taiwan and at least this zoo do take care of the animal
actually there isn't much to talk about
just a normal zoo with normal asia standard
what bring the score to 4 out of 5 is panda
the adorable panda help to attract people to visit this zoo
another good things about the zoo is very accessible
it can be reach by car, taxi, bus or subway



tip: pack a picnic and prepare to spend a relaxing afternoon!traveling on a budget, or just want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city? taipei zoo is the answer!i haven't visited a zoo in years, and after african safari i honestly thought i won't enjoy a zoo again


but taipei zoo changed my mind! zebras? checked
giraffes? oh yes! the zoo is huge - it will take a good couple hours to see all the animals, and the pandas are a favourite with visitors (especially if you have children with you!) at just nt50 a person, this is one of the best budget activity you can do with friends & family
try to go on a weekday to avoid the crowd, bring blankets and picnic basket and escape from the city buzz :)


taipei zoo takes very good care of all their animal residence
the zoo is fun and educational
one day is usually not enough to see the entire park
panda bears are one of the most popular attractions there, so plan to be waiting in line especially during weekends/holidays
the zoo is easily located right out of the mrt station



a huge zoo with plenty to see
went with my wife, twins boys and there aunt
admission was relatively cheap compared to other zoo's i have been to
was a blazing hot day so would recommend picking a day that's not too hot
lots of walking around seeing the different exhibits so not easy for toddlers or dad's pushing strollers ;) getting there was easy as an mrt station is close to the entrance
overall a good day out and well worth a visit



great way to spend a few hours, especially if you are a panda lover! lovely grounds to walk around
had to admonish the administration for their display of other zoos which feature pandas, and listed edinburgh zoo as being in england, when we all know this is in scotland!


should have gone earlier so that we could cover every corner of it! the zoo is big, well planned & maitained
my mom n my children enjoyed it too
beautiful landscapes, toilet is everywhere, very helpful staff too
was separated from mom but staff was efficient n helped to make announcements within minutes
animals there looks healthy and well fed! just make sure u have a pair of comfortable walking shoes n be prepared to explore because there is lots of things to see! entrance fees is very reasonable only ntd60 n there are convenient stores for snacks & simple meal



not a fan of zoos but i badly wanted to see pandas
too bad it was mating season so the big ones cannot be seen
the biggest zoo i've ever been to so far and it's just for 60twd
you're feet will hurt from do the walking so make sure to wear comfortable shoes
some of the animals looked sad but they are building new enclosures for the animals
the place is accessible, just a few paces from the metro and the cable car



low entrance fee with great experience as there are a lot of species and animals
good place to spend kids with



great place for family trip
sweet place with cute animals
location is prefect as it locate near the mrt system



we picked a day that was very hot and it was full of local people
the zoo itself has many animals and is quite spread out
the train that goes round the park was very busy and the queue was long
ther are plenty of places to eat and drink but a lot of locals take their own



this is a very large zoo area, and they have great animals like panda and koala bears (which you don't get to see all the time)
there is also a mini train for ntd$5 for those who does want to walk afar to watch penguins and etc
reaching the zoo is easily accessible via mrt
great place to visit!


recommendationcheck weather prior to visittake an umbrellalook for pandabear, and kuola bearsuitable for everyone in familyshall spend half a day here, followed by maokong cheap admission fee, tw dollar : 60 per pax
should visit if you have a free day in taipei


this is a pretty nice zoo if you are into animals
it's not that much different from many zoos in the us
however, the admission price is very cheap
a full priced ticket is nt $60, which is like $2 usd
a lot of people go for the panda exhibit
this is something that you do not want to miss if you make a visit
nearby the zoo is the maokong gandola carts
those are worth a ride as well



had a great day
beautiful facilities for the humans and the animal enclosures are first world and meet western standards
this is always a concern - i do not like to see animals suffering or mistreated
lovely walk
gibbons were amazing
good selection of species
giraffe's were stunning



we had a great day at the zoo
it was a rainy day, so it was very quiet, but the animals were all still out to see
the animals are in nice, large habitats and no small cages
there was plenty of educational information and i learned a lot
a great activity, rain or shine



great for kids and even adults! best for families
need to spend more than 5 hrs if u really wish to see everything inside the zoo



with a 24hr mrt ticket (us$7) and entry to the zoo (us$2
20) this could appeal as a great day out for a family, but after seeing the pandas (best feature) we passed many lonely, cold and bored looking pairs of mammals (zebras, elephants, chimps etc) that left us feeling less excited than we were on entry



brought my wife and son to visit
eight outdoor and six indoor section
took one day to see everything
very educational
guess it's the largest in asia



very easily accessible by the taipei metro system
inexpensive admission ticket
lots of tropical animals
infrastructure needs some improvement but overall its a great zoo


great for the family and it was a detour for us
after the gondolas we decided to visit the zoo; got off the zoo stop and rode the tram
it was a nice and relaxing day
kids would enjoy the animals; pandas exhibits was fun



we did this as an alternative to the long queue to the maokong gondola on a public holiday, so it was quite packed
but the entrance fee was fairly cheap so we didn't mind spending a few hours having lunch there and roaming around for the toddler
the panda exhibit is its highlight and was well maintained
they give out tickets with allocated timings to enter the indoor exhibit to prevent overcrowding which is nice
there was a very family friendly animal themed restaurant at the top of the exhibit which we enjoyed a good meal overlooking the panda exhibit 
on the expensive side though but no regrets
the children's zoo was carefully thought out and planned and our toddler enjoyed it thoroughly
the rest of the zoo was laid out well but had rather steep hills and lots of walking
we didn't get to explore the whole place as we only had a few hours but what we did see was enjoyable
overall a good zoo but could be maintained better
a great activity for the kids



i really enjoyed the atmosphere of the taipei zoo, it is well designed and had a huge variety of animals
highly recommended
it can get a bit crowded



easy to reach by metro and incredibly cheap
specialises in south east asian animals which are outside in their natural habitat
covers quite an area
don't miss the bengal tiger, the tapir, the sun bear - and particularly the pandas
we went on a weekday when it was very quiet and had no problems getting far enough forward for great photos
there's a mcdonalds for snacks
the maokong gondola is accessible from here



taipei zoo is one of the nicest zoo's we've visited
it's quite large and the animals have generally got a lot of space, so it's not one of those zoo's where animals are living in crammed conditions
the pandas (2 adults and one 2 years' old "youth") are obviously one of the main attractions but there're plenty of other animals that are lovely to see, like the large penguin house, hippos, koala bears, etc
etc
and it's excellent value for money, adult entry is twd 120 and for the under 18's it's twd 60! that's just over gbp 2 or usd 3 for entry, can't beat that
will go back when i next visit taipei, it's worth to spend 3 or 4 hours



i am totally surprised by how nice the zoo really is
i have read some negative comments on the zoo and was hesitant going there
but my adult son and i had three hours on hand after visiting the mao kong
we decided to go for it even though i had my reservations
well, we totally enjoyed the zoo
the setting of the zoo was very nice
you know you are in the tropics
unlike what others have said about the treatment of the animals (too thin), i disagree
the animals looked well taken care of
the varieties of animals being kept here is wonderful
i believe this is the largest zoo in asia
i live in dc and have seen the national zoo numerous times
this zoo is still worth your time, it is smaller but it still have many interested species that even dc zoo did not have
did i mention the entrance fee is really inexpensive? about $2 us a person?


when i go to there in july , its to hot weather when i went , but i recomended to go there because to many animal in there


easy to get to as there is a metro station right outside, admission charge is cheap as well
it's not impressive but place is quite huge so will take quite a while to explore
good for a whole day's activity, especially families with kids
do pack your own drinks and snacks as the f&b kiosks are quite a distance apart
trams are highly recommended one way as the zoo's layout is mostly one-sided



my boys love this zoo, every time we're in taipei, they want to go
the zoo is beautiful ly designed, and has lots of animals
a great place to spend a day, especially, if you have young children
it is also lots of walking, but you can take the trolley
it cost some money, very little



this zoo is actually quite large; larger than originally thought! we did not finish seeing all of the exhibits, but we did enjoy a thoroughly exhausting five hours
it was raining when we went, which was not ideal, but as a result, the zoo was not overly crowded
my son enjoyed himself, and that really is the most important thing



it's a huge zoo, where you can spend almost the whole day there
lots of animals to see, including pandas
reachable using mrt
entrance fees was very reasonable



this zoo is very spacious, and it has a great array of animals from the region
i found it disturbing that parents let their small children yell and be so noisy being that there are signs asking for a quiet environment
the zoo is very big, so i recommend going with plenty of time



we went on the first day of the lunar new year and there were many people
but we could pay for entrance tickets with our youyou card and entry to the zoo was very smooth
the park was wheelchair/strollers friendly
there was a wide variety of animals and pandas and koalas were very active!


our kids always love going to this place
many animals to see, and new exhibit halls opened
weather was very nice when we went so the kids and other tourists really enjoyed the views



we went there during weekend and it was really crowded with families
the zoo is huge and truly great
we really enjoyed it
so many animals, so green
the entrance fee is very cheap



i went during a study abroad trip in november of 2015
 the day was cool, it even rained a little bit
it was the perfect climate to see so many animals
alligators, tigers, pandas, weird bear things


every exhibit you passed, the animals were out
it was fantastic
go!


not been big zoo fans we were initially weary of going here but decided to visit to see the giant pandas
the entrance fee is really cheap- 30 nt$ and the pandas are defo worth seeing
they have a good collection of other animals as well in reasonably spacious enclosures so as zoos go probably one of the better ones



entrance ticket cost nt$60/per adult only
easy accessible by public transport, stop at metro taipei zoo station if you take mrt
variety of animals included panda, koala, penguin, bear and etc
wheelchair and baby stroller renting near to the entrance
suggest to take one way internal shuttle train at nt$5/pp only to the end of the zoo then you can explore until you reach exit



for only ntd60 for audits, there are a lot of animals including panda to be observed
a must go especially for those with children



took the crystal based cable car
the waiting time for the crystal cable car took awhile as they only have limited of it
the price is the same as normal cable car
got off at taipei zoo
nothing much about the zoo but good for children


there is a good amount of different animals on display but i was disappointed at the enclosures
it all seemed a bit dated
we went primarily to see the pandas
we only saw one, but it was cute eating its bamboo



this zoo was amazing and such good value for money
highlight of the visit seeing the baby pandas which you had to queue to see but worth the wait



to say it is lousy, is also not true
yet, i feel it is not something very amazing, nor is it very exciting
let's just say, i have been to better zoos, and taipei zoo ranks mediocrely compared to other zoos
it is not lousy
no
but perhaps, just average
a nice place for children still, but for adults, it could just be a tad boring after an hour



taipei zoo is just outside the station with the same name cheap to get to and inside
great selection of animals to see and a bird enclosure to walk around 
all information is written in english so no problem in understanding what is around 
went in june and got caught in a massive storm with no waterproof clothing so maybe check the weather if you are going as there a long walk out in the open areas great place



we came on a rainy day
stayed near taipei main station and took a cab here
subway is cheaper but needs to change line
cab was economical nevertheless
entrance fee was twd 30, i think
really underpriced for the quality of the zoo
lockers by the entrance in case you need to store stuff
a lot of wonderful animals to see
there's a mcdonald's pass the entrance so you can grab a snack
souvenirs were affordable
we spent half a day here and took the cable car from the zoo to maokong for some nice tea up in the mountains



entry tickets are cheap
this is my first visit in 30 years
the facilities are a little run down especially indoor facilities are often smelly with dampness
plenty of toilets but not all clean
need more western style toilets for younger children
when i first entered the zoo, i felt like i could see more people than animal
the signage and circulation were not well organised so could easily get lost or walking around the circle
lots to look at with long distance to walk so pace yourselves don't run out of steam



visited different zoos, but this one is worth mentioning - the variety of animals and their enclosures


they have penguins, panda, red panda and many many more







this zoo was likely very nice 10 years ago, but now, it seems like it really needs a facelift
while the animals look like they are well taken care of, the buildings are quite old
the signs and maps could improve as we found it difficult to get around



a good place to relax, infotainment and for good family outing with kids
it can be accessed by taipei metro
kids will love this place



i thought i would spend only half a day there

but i was wrong
i loved it there
the animals were so alive and healthy
its a must see in taiwan!


the zoo is one of the far place to reach, close to the maokong gondola and the tea plantation
it's really big, with a lot of crying orangos, and the big attraction of the panda, who stays hidden behind bushes, so you have to wait he decides to move and to show his bamboo appetite
like italians, he gives his best eating






it's great for just nt60! the place is big and there is a shuttle available for just nt5 if you want to get to the birds area/maokong gondola
avoid mondays as there may be closures of certain areas



it is january 10, 2015 and we spent part if our day here
this zoo is layed out fairly nice
wear comfy shoes because you'll be doing a lot of walking up and down gentle but long inclines
if you're bringing small kids: the strollers for rent look very clean and well maintained
unfortunately for us, rentals were not available due to an issue with the receipts
there are various places to eat or if you prefer, you can bring your own food and sit in one of the eating areas



this zoo is definitely a place for kids! we saw some pandas, orangutans, flamingos, monkeys, snakes and different kinds of birds
but unfortunately there's so many people that day! we went on new year's day (january 1), and boy oh boy! we have to line up just to see the pandas and the orangutans


one of the bigger zoo's i have been to with animals from all over the world
don't spend too much time at a specific animal there is a lot to get through



there isn't a lot of shaded area in this zoo, hence, summer time visit would be hot and humid, umbrella and water bootles are two must if you can't avoid summer time visit
there isn't much differences between this zoo and other zoos in other countries



besides the cute pandas and the koala bears they have here, especially the baby panda



the zoo is quite big but lucky a shuttle is provided to get to the top of the zoo, and is easy to go around with a stroller
not bad if you are travelling with children



neer a fan of zoos so dont support these places that lock up animals
this one seemed small and sad looking



it's a big zoo, you do need to walk a lot so i will advice to wear a comfy shoes and if you're expecting the animals to be active don't get your hopes high during winter alternately visit at another season because of hibernation, entrance fees are very cheap if you're unable to walk for long i recommend to go on a few trips rather than one day



the zoo is cool
we're from the us so we got to different animals
the panda was on top of my list of animals to see
a plus was seeing a red panda which i didn't know existed
the zoo is clean and there are trash cans everywhere
it takes about 4
5 hours to walk through everything
once you get to the top you can take the gondola (30 ntd) down to the bottom
it's extremely easy to get to with the subway there
definitely recommended



it isn't the biggest zoo in the world but there are plenty of animals to see
we especially liked the koalas and pandas
there's also a petting zoo for the little ones
there were bunnies s few years back but now they have closed off that area
you can see the rabbits but they can't be touched
very family friendly
we enjoyed our trip to the zoo
there's a fast food restaurant by the zoo exit
there are also plenty of other eateries inside the zoo and a family mart to purchase water and snacks



was worried this might be a third world zoo with animals kept in horrid conditions
pleasantly surprised it was as good as any western museum
reminded me of the denver zoo
huge
lots of walking around
good exhibits
nice exhibit on indigenous animals
never been to an insectarium before
giant pandas are a must, but we liked the red panda the most



if you must visit the zoo, give it a day
this zoo is so expansive it'll burn the calories you need to burn just meandering through the vast display of african, asian, and other continents' animals
the main attraction to us was of course the panda
it did not disappoint as the mother panda sauntered in the outside garden for everyone to see
one of course ponders whether irbid ethical to keep animals in general in captivity
but the
work done by the zoo authorities more than justifies their keeping the pandas in captivity
through careful nurturing and advanced science, the panda here was bred in captivity
this has allowed scientists to study how best to protect pandas in the wild
goi g through the chimpanzees and the gorilla cages was fun as these brethren of the human race somehow has the gene that gives all of us that sense of humor
i cannot explain, just go for the visit
i haven't been to too many zoos, but my family swears that this could be one of the best in the world
congratulations to taipeh!


you can see this zoo in about 3-4hours
more of you have small children
i didn't get to hold a panda but i know people who have based on "donations" or connections



awesome fun
great trip
do combine it with maokong for extracting the most out of your trip
don't miss the pygmy hippo which is extremely rare
signage could be clearer at times but it's worth it
i would suggest using the internal shuttles at the zoo to do more in less time



despite a cold and cloudy day, surprised to see lots of people here, zoo a little old but with lots of animals and staff paid lots attention to enrich the experience at the zoo
nice place to spend a day if you have kids



very clean and well maintained zoo with lots of animals
very kids friendly too as they can rent you stroller



my partner loves this zoo
it is huge! and the animals all have large enclosure to roam about
the entrance fee is so cheap and reasonable
really thumbs up to the management for being able to have such reasonable low cost entrance fee and yet keeping the zoo in good condition



can rent stroller from reception near entrance for twd50 plus a deposit of twd1000
huge place and linked to maokong
maybe its the cold weather, most of the animals were resting when we were there
place close at 6pm including the 7-11
not much to see of the panda exhibit so can skip this if short of time



wonderful place to spend the afternoon with kids
there are many, many exhibits and you can access it easily using the mrt
from the zoo, you can also go to the mekong gondola!it was 60nt per adult to enter the zoo, and food/beverages inside are inexpensive and plentiful
highly recommended for a day out (it's a pretty big zoo!)


after coming off gondola from south station, we took a shuttle to taipei zoo
there are a lot of animal variety in the zoo
but some are only a pair or even 1
 as far as i appreciate that there is a place where we can see all these animals, can't help but be sad for them also



i had the expectation that we were going to see a lot if pandas, but when we entered the "giant panda house", we saw one panda sleeping
everything else was good
the weather was really hot though, recommend you to go there in november-march



my family visited the zoo on 24 dec 2015
 the zoo is located next to the taipei zoo station
the entrance fee for an adult is nt60 which i think is very cheap for visiting a zoo with a great variety of animal and birds
it is a family oriented zoo; there were many school pupils lead by the teachers and family with kid on pram at the zoo
however, most of the animals were not active as it was winter at taipei at this point of time
the panda was sleeping soundly then
the zoo was well kept and clean
we enjoyed the visit to the zoo



nice zoo! we have been to the beijing, kyoto, okinawa, singapore and bali zoos and i think this is best we have visited in asia
hard to give it a 5 based on some us zoos i've been to, but can see why it is a top zoo in asia
they have a time system for the panda house (a block of time in which you can visit) that really keeps the crowds down
efficient and appreciated system! lots of walking overall
we went from the zoo entrance to the south zoo station without the tram and it was a lot of walking
my kids barely noticed because the exhibits were well done and close enough that there was always something to see and read about (english signs available at most enclosures)
lots of bathrooms which is always a plus (mostly squatty toilets in case you have a preference)
the only part i didn't care for was the children's zoo (small and most run down part of the zoo)
otherwise, worth a visit
i didn't notice any 'shows' or animal interactions on the map (no schedule)



its cheap but many animals are not available for viewing
some parts of the zoo are under renovation, so it may be better next time



it was raining light the day we went to the zoo
this wasn't a huge issue as it was easy to get umbrellas and rain ponchos at the 7-11 at the entrance
there are also lots of undercover areas so you aren't getting drizzled on the whole time
we had a 3 year old and 5 month old with us
plenty to see with a toddler in tow and a great shuttle train to get you to the top of the zoo - it's all downhill from the top! we saw australian, african, chinese and other animals
the giraffes were gorgeous
the pandas were lovely to see as well
best of all there were great facilities for babies - nursing rooms and very clean changing facilities at the entrance and the top of the zoo



the zoo was big but not too big
explain well for visitors and very informative
definitely worth going if you have young children



the zoo is definitely worth a visit
entrance fee is more than affordable, especially when compared to the vast exhibits available
except for elephants which i'm unsure if i have missed it, you can find almost every creature there including the pandas



this zoo is set in the mountains just outside/at the southern edge of taipei
transportation was super easy, and we used easy cards for transportation on the mrt as well as on the gondola
the easy card meant we did not have to stand in lines for tickets
what we did: we walked in and up to the left to see the pandas first
as you enter you receive a small ticket that is for the panda house
there are no marking on the ticket, so we weren't sure what they were for until we saw them being used at the panda house
we then walked up the hill, enjoying each of the areas
rich photo opportunities with butterflies as well as animals abound
at the top, we took the bus to the maokong gondola, which we then took to the end of the 4-kilometer route
we used the easy card at each transportation step, and thankful we were since not having to buy tickets saved all sorts of line time
some people took the train up and then walked down the mountain, visiting exhibits in reverse order
as we continued to climb, we talked about how smart that was--up until we saw the gondola line at the end of the day at the bottom--about 3:20pm
nope
better to arrive early, walk up the mountainside and then take the gondola from the midpoint
we spent almost two hours here and did not see it all
most people there were with small children and my adult children noted how well-behaved the adults were with their children
*smile*


though the zoo entrance fee was cheap (less than 3sgd?) and the zoo was really big, i was quite disappointed as animals like the koalas and pandas can only be seen via a piece of glass in between (and hence lousy photos taken)
had to walk quite a distance to view the next attraction as well
if you only have a few days in taipei, i wouldn't recommend this place, but if you are staying for maybe more than 2 weeks, no harm visiting as the entrance fee is cheap



my hiking date was cancelled so i was kind of wandering around with my hiking sticks along the river and came upon the zoo
for 60 ntd i found a locker (20 ntd) stashing the backpack and hiking poles
armed with a banana, water bottle, and some almonds i set off on a great adventure meeting all kinds of fabulous animals and people
at the bird exhibits while gawking at a blue bird with amazing head feathers i struck up a conversation with a fascinating designer who was marveling at this birds colors and textures only to reveal that she herself is a textile designer living in australia who does trunk shows in london, paris and other european cities with parents whom she visits in beijing
the most fascinating animal was a rat pig like creature whose name escapes me but began with tim
the dromedarian camels did not appreciate my singing of jingle bells with ringing bells - he uprighted himself and strode away
there were lush red poinsettas about, some christmas balls



the lions were napping, the tiger was making noises and walking about, the giant panda was quite adorable and moving
i arrived about 10:30 a
m
and the crowds were light - lovely strolling
by the time i left in the afternoon - very crowded with great cocophany of crying
bathrooms and eateries were conveniently placed throughout
ample parking in a large garage
train service throughout zoo grounds
gondola rides not far from entrance



our visit to the taipei zoo was happenstance
i wasn't expecting much, based on the ticket price but was pleasantly surprised
it's large, airy with lots of greenery
we only had 2
5 hours to spend, and only got as far as the panda enclosure
the educational centre (additional nt20 per pax to enter) was pretty exciting and interactive
there was a lot of information, from the history of the zoo to environmental messages to dinosaur exhibits
we ended up spending most of our time there
wished the animal exhibits were better maintained
the insectorium barely had any animals and a number of animal enclosures were empty
of course, the cold weather may have been a factor
it's no singapore zoo, but given the price it's actually not bad
wished i had more time (and energy) to see the gorilla!


if you have young children, this is a highly recommended place to bring them to
entrance ticket is so affordable
fantastic zoo with a lot of animals to see
clean and well kept



great day out even though weather was cold
saw many different animals
lovely grounds and well looked after
this was followed by a trip up the mountain in a cable car wow!!!!!!


was initially very excited to go see this place as many friends recommended it
when we got there, it was field trip day for the local kids so needless to say there were many teenagers running around and yelling throughout our visit
the animals were either hiding or not in their enclosures
the only exhibit worth seeing are the giant pandas
the souvenir shop for the giant pandas was also great



we loved the panda's! it was definitely a different experience
my kids enjoyed the trip
we also rode the maokong gondola :)


taipei zoo is a fairly large zoo located at the end of the light railway line in taipei
it is a zoo with a good spread of animals - african savannah, reptiles, birds, and asian animals
it would take a good couple of hours to walk and look at everything
entry price is remarkably low and is can be paid for using easycard
the zoo caters really well for children - the main audience
there is a children's zoo near the entrance with a nice set of fairly familiar animals to enjoy
other areas are also great for children including the reptile area which has a lot of great information in both mandarin and english
the bird section is not so great but most of the areas seem to be of a decent size for the animals within
this is not a safari but there is good spacing and aside from the birds the animals do not look cramped
with the size of the place there is a train to travel around
it does not take a very scenic route so the journey is for its own sake rather than to see things en route
the train can be paid for using easycard and costs hardly anything
the routing and signage is not great
it is actually quite easy to get around the zoo but the signage is not especially helpful
there are plenty of rest stops around the zoo with tables and occasionally food/drink to buy
this is a place that caters well for children and has the right facilities
in many areas of the grounds
the key attraction is the giant pandas, always a winner
taipei zoo is a pretty good one
well kept and with good facilities



i made a horrible mistake by going to the zoo on one of the many 35 degree days (that's 95 f)
it was humid and hot and miserable
the zoo was mostly empty so i could see anything i wanted including the pandas, which were adorable, easily
all of the animals however were very lethargic because of the heat and humidity
they just all slept in the shade and i don't blame them one bit! i was dying and sweating like a pig! the only respite from the heat was going in the air-conditioned panda zone
they were very cute



we were in taipei for a conference and had an afternoon to burn - took the mtr out to the cable-car and zoo stop - if you check the cable-car schedules you can do both on an afternoon and have a great day! truly a world-class zoo -landscaped into the side of a mountain, the animal habitats are thoughtfully laid out and 21st-century naturalistically built
i finally got to see a panda - yay - and koala bears that had the crowds captivated
there's also a nice cafe & shop by the entrance, and a tram that runs from one end of the zoo to the other if you don't want to walk the whole length back again after you've seen everything
entrance was very reasonable - a few ntwd per person, and of course the mtr is easy and also inexpensive, so it was a great day overall!


we decided to take the cable car at the zoo station and alighted at the first stop (they've about 3 stops altogether) to enter the zoo
after which you have to pay nt5 for a one way shuttle ride to the entrance
i understand that must have been only a side or rear entrance but it would have been nice to made it more welcoming, with maps or brochures
as a result it was pretty difficult to navigate around as we seemed to have entered from nowhere
missed a number of attractions as a result including the tigers and lions :(other than that, the zoo is clean and generally well maintained
both the cable car and zoo tickets (bought separately) are very cheap and value for money
the panda exhibition was a let down
basically 10 seconds of moving along a viewing deck where you're being constantly blasted at to "move forward"
met into a student volunteer who was extremely rude, though that was of no fault of the zoo



taipei zoo has extremely cheap admission fee, ntd60
it has a lot of animals from different regions such as australian kangaroos and pandas from china
though you might experience being rushed impolitely by the staffs at panda hall when it's crowded, but overall, it is definitely worth a visit alone or with friends



convenient to get to with the mrt, last stop on the wenshan-neihu line
the maokong gondola station next to it (350m)
the gondola was not operating while we were there due to strong winds
you can take a train shuttle for nt5 and walk down back down towards the entrance area
the animals are grouped into different areas
expect a reasonable amount of walking time to get through all the exhibits
we spend about 1
5 hrs and did not finish looking at all the exhibits
we took the train down to the entrance area for nt5, it was too long a walk back
be prepared with snacks
there is not a lot of place to find snacks, just vending machine for drinks
there is a mcdonalds at the entrance area for food



lovely visit with our 3 year old grandson
busy on a sunday but we still managed to see the pandas with ease
great exercise walking around the park and selecting which animals to see
zebra, lions, monkeys, rhino and elephants were the favourites until we arrived at the panda house
use you mrt card for entry too



if you like animals and especially with children, taipei zoo is a must to visit
it may take you more than 1/2 day for the visit
also nice locations



this is a good zoo overall, with several animal and bird exhibits
however, the panda bear exhibit is a bit disappointing
when i visited, the two giant pandas were asleep and no photos were allowed
however, the scenery around the zoo is lovely and it's close to the tramway that takes you up to the top of a small mountain where you can walk and stop for tea or a meal in one of the cafes and restaurants
it's a good day's outing



i've been to the zoo 3 times and it's so cheap that it can be nice for some exercise and seeing some manufactured "nature"
but for tourism i think you can skip it, unless you really love animals or don't get to see zoos too often
they have pandas and certainly a ton of animals but nothing that most zoos don't already have
and i've been to the san diego zoo and once you go to that one every other zoo seems boring



the zoo is huge! we spent about 2-2
5 hours and managed to cover about 1/3 of the animal exhibits
(note: we walk along the trail and observe the animals n at times read the panels as well, that's why we can't cover the whole zoo)
one plus point, 'easy card' can be used to scan in for admission and we save time as we didn't need to queue to purchase tickets
do rem to collect the panda viewing coupon upon admission as a specific timing for viewing
this is given to prevent overcrowding
if you have time, you can check out the panda cafe on level2 of the panda enclosure
the waffles is nice!the shuttle bus that goes around the zoo was packed with people
we didn't have time to queue for the bus, so we headed to the children zoo area
the kids section of the zoo was a little disappointing as there were few types of animals and there wasn't any feeding at the time we were there
the best animal exhibit was actually the camel
it came up close to the fence and allowed visitors to pet it
and of course it 'spits' at people too


:)note: we went on a weekend and it was crowded



this was my least favorite thing to do in taiwan
there were some nice animals but there was nothing extraordinary that you couldn't see at any other zoo in the states
it is extremely hot in taipei (and i went in october) and there were hills to walk up and down and it just didn't seem worth it to do all that sweating



this was a gigantic zoo! the animals had large habitats that were tailored to the critter
animals looked healthy and well-fed
there were a lot of crowds but the animals were still easily viewed
plenty of places to rest, eat and relax
the gondola runs nearby and you can see it from the zoo
strollers were available for rent and there was only one breastfeeding room available at the front of the zoo



the zoo is pretty big and the key attraction would be the panda for us
do plan to visit in the morning where the crowd is lesser



taipei zoo is easy to navigate since it is not too big making it great to walk around
it has various interesting animals, especially the giant panda
the entrance fee is affordable and the zoo has complete amenities



intimate scale, but have almost every animals you can think of - koala, panda bears to local particulars
a gem in taiwan



full value for money with an excellent collection of animals and birds
the panda house and penguin house are top attractions



recommended for families with young kids
place is clean
toilets are situated almost everywhere
food stalls are abit limited though
pandas, penguins & koalas- a must to visit
entrance fees:1) adults- nt$ 602) children- nt$ 30operating hours:364 days a year (closed during cny eve) 09
00am - 05
00pm dailybest to take mao kong gondola up-hill to 'taipei zoo south station'
alight from the gondola & walk down-hill as you exit the zoo
not too tiring
would require approximately about 6-8 hours to cover the whole zoo (pending walking speed)



kudos to the zoo for maintaining such a low entrance ticket (only 60twd for adult!) when there are high maintenance animals like pandas and koala bears in the zoo! from camels to elephant to gorilla to penguins to lemurs
great fun to watch :d the aviary is rather interesting too! recommend to take the shuttle (50 twd if i'm not mistaken) which brings you near to the aviary/reptile house/penguins etc
if not it's gonna be a long walk
another shuttle brings you from that point to the maokong gondola station in the zoo itself (no separate line for crystal cabin at this station - the operator arranges according to the line and your no
of passengers)



the taipei zoo is the best zoo that i've been to
lots of areas for pictures and great for kids
the place is huge so prepare to spend the day there and wear sneakers!


have been to taiwan many times but never made it to the zoo
easy to get to, right off the mrt stop
so cheap to get in, we couldn't believe it
we went on a weekday so it wasn't very crowded and we were able to spend as much time as we wanted in the panda area
saw 2 pandas and they were both quite active while we were there, so was lots of fun
we also saw the penguins and koalas
the zoo overall seems very well maintained with beautiful greenery while walking around
the zoo is definitely on the larger side and requires some walking
we took advantage of the shuttle 5 nt per person each ride, exact change required, to save us some walking
note - they stop running the shuttle to maokong gondola after a certain time, we had planned to do this, but we were too late, so double check the times on that if you are interested
you can still always do the gondola outside of the zoo
anyway, we had a great time and it was so inexpensive so great value for the $



we go to the zoo in virtually every city we visit
the taipei zoo was fine, but not outstanding
the pandas are the highlight, but as with every zoo, the other exhibits are diminished because of them
great tapirs
lovely grounds
easy to get to and close to the maokong cable car



we visited the zoo primarily to have a look at the animals native to taiwan but sadly, did not see much except for the monkeys
elsewhere in the zoo, many exhibits were undergoing refurbishment (end nov 2015)
exhibit areas are hit and miss - the tapir enclosure is interesting, but some others could be improved
i also had my concerns about the tropical animals being in open areas during my visit (temperature was below 20c)
this is a big zoo but walkable, to "do" it properly would probably take the entire day
we exited the zoo through the south entrance (going to the maokung gondola) but for anyone doing the same, here's a tip - the staff do not give change for the shuttle bus rides and you will have to go to the food shop (temperate area display) to do that
attitute of some zoo staff needs adjustment - quite a change from the usually helpful and friendly service we got elsewhere in taipei
does not merit a return trip



this is right out at the end of the mrt but very easy to get to
lovely big enclosures for the animals but sadly so few on view and many solitary animals pacing back and forth
one gorilla, one tiger etc
pandas are on a timed ticket and you can't stay long to see them



this is one fantastic zoo! so many beautiful animals, great layout, easy to walk around
a lot to see for everyone
go during the weekdays, we didn't need to queue anywhere, even had lots of space to view the giant panda's



the zoo is not big but numerous animals are kept there
very informative and educational for families with children to go there


i have read not so pleasant reviews about this place but i feel that taipei zoo deserves a higher rating
the place is big and requires lots of walking
love the penguins and the panda
the place gave me smiles and reminisced childhood amazement for live animals
you may bring in food and drinks but food and drinks inside are not pricey like other zoos and amuzement parks
if you have kids, this place is good for relaxing and having a good weekend



the zoo was very clean and set out well with gardens
plenty of eating places there and fun things for children to do



came because of the gondolaplace is nice weather was nice when we're there but u can still feel the sun in ur face, place needs more shadesdon't ride the train inside the zoo
it will only disorient you
gondola is at mrt taipei zoo station
or at the south end of the zoo if u plan to go inside
nt$10 cheaper if u ride the gondola at south end of the zoo



i am trill to see many animals and the best part is the entrance fee is cheap and you can use your easy card too to skip the queue
the zoo layout is systematic as you make loop to see each part of the zoo divided by continental with a main trunk road
the queue for food is long but the sausage hot dog was yummy
worth queuing for



we actually learned two tricks from the locals to either take the gondola and get off on the first stop, or to pay nt$5 (or 10) to get in through the front entrance and take the trolley to the end where the bird exhibits were to avoid the crowd and having to walk all uphill
we decided to take the gondola and found out there is free trolley that takes you to the bird area, from there it's all downhills as you walk through each exhibits towards the front entrance of the zoo
i like how most exhibits are easy for the little ones to see at their height and safe for them to run around a bit
they also hand out your tickets to the panda exhibits for a certain time, but by the time we got around to the panda exhibit we have already past our designated time
i wonder if we could've request a later time when we got it
overall it was pretty fun for the little one, a lot of picture opportunities and doesn't smell too bad



the taipei zoo is probably one of the best (and most time consuming) things you can do in taipei
what's great is that it benefits mountain backdrops and natural settings
packed with animals from around the world, insects and other curiosities, stayed there 4 hours and feeling like i missed half of everything! cafes and snacks are available inside the zoo



the panda didn't move an inch the while time i was there, haha
but i'm still giving 5 stars because it really is cool zoo


really big with so many animals


and i had a good time
you can take the mrt right to the zoo



went there with my 1
5 years old and 3
5 years old, they both love it
we reached there around afternoon thus didn't have much time to explore all the area
the zoo is very clean and spacious
the entrance fee is very cheap and the food stall that selling snacks inside also pretty cheap with enough portion for us to share
we enjoyed our visit there and definitely will consider again for our future visit



as a big fan of visiting zoos all over the world, this one strikes me as being pretty average
there were a number of exhibits that were just empty, particularly in the formosa section, however, the temperate zone farthest from the gate was the most interesting area of the zoo
the panda and penguin exhibits were among the best
there are some restaurants in a few places, so the whole bring your own food isn't entirely necessary
it's a fairly large zoo and the reviews about walking a lot are entirely accurate
you can't beat this price, though, so in the end if you like zoos this one is definitely worth the price and a day of your time



if you have little child/children, you can take them to visit this zoo because this zoo has unique animals from different place
this zoo also have penguin and you can ride the train car inside the zoo if you don't want to walk



visited it oct 2015, wonderful weather, not crowded at all, very accessible by mrt, a wide variety of animals, birds and flies



my friend took me and my girl there on sat, crowded but needed not to line up for long time
took the zoo bus and found the facilities are very thoughtful to parent(s) with kid(s)
enough spacing for the strollers and the staff are friendly and very helpful, they even helped me to carry the stroller up and down from the bus
really appreciated



taipei zoo is constantly improving and has been a pleasure each time i visit there
the trip there on the mrt (brown line) is breathtaking! the mrt exit is right by the zoo and is super convenient 
all the animals are in great condition and the zoo offers great child friendly information and activities around the zoo
the entrance fee is super cheap and affordable for everyone
do visit the bird area as the experience is out of this world!i would advice to ride the train up to the end of the trail and make your way down as the zoo is really vast
walking downhill is much better than walking up
:) do try the jumbo hotdogs and locate the poo wall!!


not a zoo person
usually go for the sanctuary if i can
this zoo, had something i longed to see, pandas
it's only a couple american dollars to enter
it connects from the mrt, so it's easy to get to
rode the trolley inside the zoo upon arrival
i recommend this because it's a good size zoo
trolley is a separate cost, it's ntd $5, you can pay with your easypass
the area where the pandas hang out is a good size, there is an outdoor section and then an indoor section
got to see the red pandas as well, which were super cute
free filtered water is offered through the whole park


large park, variety of animals
a shuttle bus takes visitors to maokong where you can enjoy taiwanese tea and view



it was ok, certainly can drop in to have a look especially if you're on the way to shengkang street or maokong
entrance fee is twd 50



this is the first time i have been to the taipei zoo
i really enjoyed my visit
the animals were housed in their natural surroundings
(as natural as possible i guess) i went to see the pandas but they were sleeping
be prepared to do a lot of walking


especially tough in the heat
good thing is there were plenty of machines that dispense cold drinks throughout the zoo
after the zoo, you can take a shuttle to go to the gondola



$60nt for general admission, accepts easycard
try to go early in the morning or late in the afternoon, since the animals aren't active in the height of the daytime heat
there is air conditioning in some of the buildings
the penguin house, the reptile house, and the panda house come to mind, so plan your itinerary
do go to the panda house first if you're early, before the crowds of schoolkids mob the viewing stations
you can take the maokong gondola from within the zoo, knocks off $10nt versus starting at the mrt station



the zoo is well laid out, there is a lot of walking, which we enjoyed
some of the enclosures looked small to me, it wasn't crowded in october
there did seem to be a whole school there, however
bird and butterfly enclosure lovely
there are very few snack places, my husband had a beef and a pork roll and they were delicious
the street food is the best food in taipei
very easy to get to the zoo, the train stops at it!


we visit the zoo as an afterthought, but we are glad that we see it
against the back drop of the high maokong mountains, its is beautifully landscaped to blend with nature, recreating a rain forest environment for the animals housed there
you can easily spent 3-4 hours walking the small paths under the shaded trees, admiring the exotic birds, watching a mountain lion or a kola bear


probably in the tp 15% of zoo's and a hidden gem close to taipei
don't miss the panadas
there is enough to see to spend two days meandering
skip weekends anfd hoildays if you are claustrrophobic



lovely layout and wasn't too busy
only downside was that the day was too hot and the animal were sleeping most of the time
would need a good half day to spend enough time with family


so firstly, there are pandas living at this zoo
the panadas are pretty sleepy, but sometimes you get to see them moving around
i love the layout of this zoo
it feel like a park
some of the exhibits are in doors, but most of them are very integrated with the layout and have you winding around in a way that makes you forget the time
there is also a great variety of animals from all over the world
i think people often overlook the bug house at taipei zoo, but they have a butterfly room that is one of my favorite places in all of taipei
i believe that general admission is $40 ntd to go the zoo (maybe its changed) that is like $1
25 usd
there is a lot of uphill walking, and i would think twice about going if i had physical concerns
i would also think about packing my own lunch
there are plenty of places to eat, but none of them are great, and you might end up waiting 30 minutes in line at the mcdonalds
you would have to walk 10 minutes outside the zoo to get to other food options



i'm from omaha nebraska, and we have one of the top zoos
the zoo in taipei was very good
the grounds were very nice
tropically landscaped
vending machines with drinks everywhere, many gift shops
many food/snack shops
many places to sit down
many restrooms
the exhibits looked nice and there were a variety of animals
the pandas were fun to watch
the admission price was surprisingly low
60 dollars
the mrt has a station by the zoo (actually you can see into the zoo from the mrt station), and the cable car also has a station for the zoo
we visited every single exhibit and were there for a little over 4 hours
bring some comfortable shoes!


i'm an animal lovers so i went to the zoo my first full day in the city
entry was 60 ntd which is a bargain $1
83 us!! the zoo grounds are very spread out so wear comfortable shoes; you'll be doing a lot of walking
the big negative on the day i visited was that there were well over a thousand school children spread throughout the grounds, in groups of 20-30
several times i had to wait for them to move on as they were so loud they frightened the animals into hiding
i was happy to see that the animals were being treated well by the staff, from the interactions i saw



large, clean zoo
great for kids
admission price is ridiculously low
while it is not one of taipei's landmarks but kids totally enjoyed it
do bring own food
downside is that there is not that many drinks and food stations at the zoo and due to the distance between exhibits if you run out of drinks


kids do get very grumpy



we went here on a hot day
avoid that! the animals were lazy and it was really troublematic to walk around in the sun all the time
it was a good of variation of animals
sadly it was a quite few of every species, like only two pandas, and you were rushed to move on and could not see the pandas for that long
but for 30 nt$ its totally worth it



going in the early afternoon was probably a bad idea, because i discovered the pandas (which were really what i came to see) asleep behind branches in their enclosure
even the penguins (which are my favorite animals) appear to be playing a game of 'who is able stand still the longest?' because that was all they did for the 10 or so minutes i spent watching them
train services were good for getting you from one end of the zoo to the other, but poor signage leading to the actual train stop caused me to get lost several times before finally discovering it
why are there multiple 'train stop' signs if the actual stop isn't there? or were we supposed to follow the trail of them towards the actual one? food quality was poor
most of the food advertised wasn't available, and what was available was stale and dry and felt like they've been prepared days ago
i am sad to say that mcdonalds was the one saving grace in terms of food
anyone who knows mcdonalds would understand why this is incredibly depressing
on the bright side, the gift shops had some amazingly cute stuffed animals
got myself a very cuddly stuffed panda, which traveled around in my bag with me for the rest of the day
advice to others: get the ones that look like real pandas, as opposed to the faux teddy-bear kinds


very nice place 
many type of animal are their 
giraffe is most beauty full animals in the zoo
good map & train are helping us to visit the zoo easily



the animals were so lazy, most of them didnt show :(
buttttt we saw the panda- so cute so lovely
nice to go with children, large yards between the caves, they can run trying to search for unlazy animals
the monkeys were funny
the zoo is so organized and clean



we travelled with our 1
5-year-old baby
he looks so interesting in this zoo
it have panda but just 2 or 3
 not as big as chengdu place
:)


thinking of trying the maokong gondola, might aswell visit the zoo as both attractions are at maokong mrt station
a few portion inside the zoo are still under construction, would recommend to visit probably 6month to 1year later till the zoo fully operation



even we arrived at the zoo in late afternoon and raining
but we are happy to see panada actively "entertaining" us
we were surprised to see the kola bears happily taking their meals and busy moving around to find position to continue their sleep



missed the panda in singapore so super excited to see them here
so cheap
quite large and very natural enclosures for some of the animals
butterflies awesome too, you can have them on your hands if you want
make sure you also take the gondola up the mountain
also very cheap
full day's activities doing both



weather is cloudy today so not so hot and sweaty
wow! it is amazing to see all my favourite animals here
unfortunately you cannot feed the animals
great place for kids, environmentally friendly



this zoo, operated by the government is great for kids
provided that it's not a hot summer day, you will find lots of attractions, facilities
you can goto take a short bus trip for the cable car



be prepared to spend all day at this lovely zoo
really easy to reach by public transport (right by the mrt station) and embarrassingly cheap to enter
one cannot help think what they could achieve with the potential revenue of doubling entry fees, which would still make it less than half the price of european zoos
with the exception of the tigers - which always seem to lose out, everywhere - it seems all the animals are in enclosures of a suitable size, with a good amount of enrichment
the successful birthrates are testament to the animal care here, as is the security offered to a number of rescued animals, given an opportunity of a good quality of life after being injured in the wild (e
g
losing limbs being hit by cars)
on a cooler october day, most of the critters were active, which is a real crowd-pleaser
come on a weekday, when the crowds are few
this zoo has some real coup animals
the likes of koalas, pandas, and thankfully a whole areas dedicated to the native animals, including the bears - and where else would you be able to see a formosan pangolin?one of the most pleasing elements, strangely, is the farmyard area
so, rabbits and pigs may not be exotic, but to children living their lives in a city the size of taipei, it's educationally so important they get chance to encounter a live chicken and dairy cow somehow, somewhere
here they can


and encounter is exactly right, as they are largely free-roaming
check out the 'aviary'
birds of all sizes and colours fly freely; in an enclosure that size, it's almost impossible to see where the netting begins



the zoo is decent sized and was a lot of fun
my only recommendation is that you should try to go on cloudy days and if possible, during the week
we went on a monday and it wasn't crowded at all - we were able to see all the animals without being overrun by a ton of people



taipei zoo offers you value for money
entrance is 1
5 euro and so is also the zoo
not the level of let say europe zoo or the shenzhen zoo (china) i visited last
not really great but due to the almost free income worth a visit



we recently went to taipei city zoo and my daughter loved it
one of the most well maintained and clean zoo, i have seen
their prized collection is pandas and penguins
my daughter just loved them
zoo also has an entry point to gandola on the south side and we took a ride upto makakong
they also have a small train shuttle if you can't walk the entire distance
bring your walking feet along if you want to see the entire zoo
it is huge and will require at-least 3-4 hours if you want to see every enclosure



taipei zoo is better than singapore zoo
an animal would feel lucky to live in taipei zoo
we took thr kid and came here for 2nd time, and we can't get enough of it
raptile house is nicely designed



i love zoos
when i went to this zoo half of it was being repaired after a typhoon had destroyed a good portion of it
they still have cool attractions like the panda bear, a roaring lion and a screaming cougar
we started walking back into the park where the devastation from the typhoon had hit and i almost had a heart attack by walking into a giant wood spider that was as big as my face, true story



they have pandas there! and its been recently renovated
clean and roomy, the zoo has an open area where animals are free to mix with each other
lots of food stands for the kids and areas to hike
take the mrt (brown line) that connects directly there



excellent zoo, much better than tokyo
the grounds are extensive so bring your walking feet
there is a small train shuttle to the top if you need it
we went early and spent from about 9am til 2pm, this included lunch but not a lot of time at each exhibit, so could easily take a full day
we fitted the maokong gondola in after as it is very close by
great enclosures for the animals, we saw a lot as it was not too hot and many animals were moving about
getting there early gave us a head start on the school groups (there were plenty) but even later in the day the park was so big that it was not crowded
highly recommend this zoo, and the price is unbelievable (60nt for adults, kids under 6 free, this is about au$2
50!! for a top quality zoo)



we went today to this zoo, 60nt$ entrance fee is very reasonable
the park is actually quite big and has alot of animals
unfortunately as it was quite hot most animals were hiding in the shadow and sleeping



the zoo itself is vast and complete, with animals from around the world
no particular aspect that will blow your mind
it was very crowded when we visited it



very cheap place good idea to go there are not many animals but there are 2 giant pandas you can enjoythere is food on this attraction nice shops with good prices also a bus to move around the cheapest zoo i had ever tried and it is by the end of the brown line, zoo station please mark down this as a helpful opinion , since it is a free contribution to the website thanks


lots to see
we spent about 4 hours walking the various areas
there are a lot of animals
all up hill walk


we loved our visit to the zoo
we toured the children's area and the asian area
in between we saw the cute koalas and were thrilled to see the pandas (one)
we even saw several animals we were unfamiliar with
it was an overcast day and cooler than it had been earlier, so all the animals were awake and performing for us
however the orangutan was shy
he stayed on a high branch and kept looking over his shoulder to see if we were still there
then turned back so we could only see his back


but we caught on to his game and got lovely photos of his face! even the siberian tiger roamed around and drank water from his pond
we had never seen malayan tapirs before so were quite entertained by them as well
tip: watch the weather and the calendar
very busy on weekends and holidays
animals were very active in mid afternoon as there wasn't any sun



very fun! though very crowded, as most zoos tend to be
the zoo is well organized, going by climate/region
the pandas were a bit hyped up with a long line and little to see, but hey- it's a panda! there is a convenient shuttle to the gondola within the park
the entrance is too cheap to pass up! only 60nt per adult and 30nt per student
don't miss the tapirs or the awesome bird cage



taipei zoo is becoming a little oldish but people are now renovating many parts of it
you can feel the animals are well taken care of and have spacious areas
our kid loved it and it has been a great walk for the adults as well
from the zoo it is also recommended to go on the gondola to have a nice view of taipei



for only nt$60, you get to see many animals to see in this place
pandas is a must visit stop in the zoo
the bird areas are also very interesting as you can experience birds flying around you
if not rush, actually can spend more than half a day at the zoo
there is also a macdonald inside the zoo for you to replenish your energy after visiting



taipei zoo is great value for money
the pandas are so special
it was such a privilege to get to see them
another highlight was the gorilla
each section of the zoo offers alot to see
you get some cheap eats at mcdonalds and there were numerous retail outlets



big zoo with very low entrance fees of twd 60 / 30 for child
seeing the panda is a must activity in zoo and can travel to maokong with cable car
pretty good crystal cable car experience



nothing to rave home about but its a decent zoo to spend the day in
we entered throught the south entrance from the gondola
overall with the gondola experience it's a nice half day activity



surprised at how affordable the zoo entrance fee is! the place is quite big, good variety of animals
try to be there as it opens as it can get really crowded



better than most asian zoos but it's still sad to see large animals like bison alone in small enclosures
for us the much-hyped giant panda exhibit was a disappointment as the people crowded around the window were not going to move for anyone, so we gave up
perhaps the staff need to keep people moving as we were there on a quiet day - good luck if it's busy



the bird sanctuary is a place to sooth one's soul in this busy metropolis
we love to see the mandarin ducks and the pink flamingos but we love how the birds' song lifts our spirits
we also love that there are alot of good cheap food around the park



taipei zoo has been updated since when i was a kid and it has certainly kept up with the times
it is very easily accessible via the mrt and also provides strollers and wheel chairs for free
starting in the zoo is all uphill, obviously when exiting, it is all downhills so if you are with people who can't walk very well like my parents, then you will need to get a wheelchair in order to walk all the way around the zoo
there is a tram/shuttle available at the entrance of the zoo to take folks up to the top of the zoo, so you can walk downhill back to the exit
overall, it is a very good zoo for a busy city like taipei!


since i had time to kill, i decided to go to the zoo
there's a great selection of animals for viewing
i especially enjoyed the area for insects, because you get to see butterflies up close and personal
the line for the panda viewing was so long so i chose not to go line up anymore
best to come here when the weather's cooler
animal lovers will enjoy



i love zoos, have been to taipei zoo for more than 10 times
they don't change anything drastically, but the maintainence is pretty high quality


i visited taipei zoo on a sunny day in may last year
taipei zoo was really big , i took whole day to visit i,but i still couldn't see all the animals in taipei zoo
i saw many special animals in taipei zoo like tigers, pickocks, snakes, lizards, parrots, pumas and penguins


it was really a nice place



although not being a great fan of animals in captivity this is a great way to see pandas
also the zoo is very well laid out and presented



spent almost a day here with friends and we really enjoyed ourselves
there is a large assortment of animals and the panda was the highlight



they have the panda enclosure with a close view as well as the elephant compound
it is nicely laid out and easy to get to



if you like animals, you must need to go there
there are many animals, more than what we expect
location is good convenient that you can go there by train



many animals are behind the glass, which is dirty, so in few cases you cant really see anything
but this zoo have much to offer!


it was hot and humid, but good to see the two giant pandas, though one of them was sleeping, the other one was quite active! try to avoid school holidays and weekend



i had trouble choosing between "average" and "very good", attractions and guides are not too clear for non-chinese speakers
i went on a sunday, the zoo was very crowded, which is understandable, however, we saw fewer attractions because of the crowds
i hope they add more english signage to assist visitors



we were treated to some amazing panda kungfu by the little panda - that alone was worth the very affordable admission prices
coupled with a trip to maokong, it was a morning well-spent
there's a shuttle bus from inside the zoo to the maokong gondola stop via the zoo's back entrance, so no need to double back to the stop outside the main entrance



well laid out zoo with plenty of viewing areas to see the animals
all open air enclosures
all big five animal are here as well as two giant pandas who are worth the enterence fee alone
you can get a cable up to the top of the zoo and walk down
best way as it's always hot and humid
go early as crowds can build up around the pand display
cable car goes up to top of mountain where lots of shops are located
best if all entry to zoo is only ntd60 per adult less than two dollars u
s
!


i am with some other reviewers who like me were not terribly impressed with taipei zoo
i seemed to walk and walk and walk and walk but i just felt that i did not actually see very much
i found the zoo layout somewhat confusing and it seemed to me that the place was just about asleep and that includes the animals
i have seen a number of more interesting zoos in china and elsewhere



we do not normal visit zoo's but thought we would give this one a try so we could see the giant panda glad we did but will not be going back


i have actually intend to give a terrible rating but after i saw so many reviewers giving that rating i feel sad not just for the animals but the zookeeper as well so i give poor rating only !!! this zoo is very big u cant finish wandering within a day even u go to this place very early in the morning simply because they categorise the animals in a stupid & wasteful manner
to the extent i feel confused and exhausted and mind you if u go there at summer u will definitely piss off with their environment !!! i wonder why the animals over there like to sleep / even hiding ?! i feel hilarious 


and it becomes a laughing stock among my friend as we came as a group !!! even the cute panda too 



one is old and looks out of energy and the other one fall asleep !!! in fact many of the animals is sleeping my goodness lol












mind you we came at day time i suppose they sleep at day time and having their activity at night time !!! by taking an example if u looking for deer


u will only see one deer in the cage and it applies to other animals only one in the cage lol





there are some positive points which i found within this zoo
it is the trees & plants rather than the animals is the focal point !!! they looks well keep than the animals lol




and the zookeepers are all senior citizen !!! i guess the youngster in taipei also find out this zoo to be boring !!! seriously i find it hard to digest this and i keep telling my friend how good my country zoo is



in fact my country zoo also not within a world class standard but it is far better than this one !!! if u are expecting the signboard to assist u along the way in order to save out your energy simply " forget it " it makes matter worse !!! can u imagine by just walking in a slow mode it sapped lot of my energy ??? it is that big even though they did provides some mini-train and also a shuttle bus but to no avail
my initial plan with my friend is to go after zoo early in the morning then go to the next tourist attraction " maokong l shape cable car " but unfortunately it ends up we missed the maokong altogether and the worse part is we even unable to finish our visit in the zoo
the best part is the zoo closed at 5pm and they closed it sharp at 5pm even before 4
45pm




so no mini-train no shuttle bus and lucky we got legs so we walk lol apporiximately 35 minutes !!! my advise is folks please for god sake " skip " this very poor zoo for the poor animals out there !!! absolutely rubbish & time wasted !!!


very well laid out, a lot to see and easy to get too
entry price was very cheap as well
the zoo was kept clean and tidy and was well sign posted throughout



if time permits visit the zoo with the kids
my husband and i just walked through the park
kuala and panda bears are kept well
lots of walking
take redline 2 and transfer to 1
 get off at the last station
easy to get there



big but does not have as many animals as expected
entry fee into the zoo is a mere $60tdw per adult/$30twd
the design is cute, nice
last stop on the wenhu line,can take bus in very cheap price is like 5 taiwan dollar which is only 25 cent usd



we just loved this zoo
it's not as fancy as other zoo's
but the price is only 120tw$
and they have numerous animals that are taken care of very well



worth going as there are different kinds of species, never feel bored
only twd60 (adult) and you can enjoy whole afternoon with the lovely animals
especially love the baby giraffe, it's too cute, better visit before it grows up ;)the zoo is quite big, take much time n energy to walk around, or you may consider to pay for the little train for a ride
but quite disappointed that failed to find animals in some cages, i think they are empty instead of hiding somewhere



the zoo charges next to nothing to enter and is huge
the panda enclosure is well cared for and the bears were both snoozing mid morning when i was there
the videos of the baby panda growing up were adorable
no queues on the friday morning i went



it is a spread out zoo and you must have good walking shoes
while many sections were quite delightful but in the orangutan and other big ape sections were quite sad to see - they really looked so sad all by themselves
for the first time i felt that they were like human being kept in isolated life imprisonment



i went around mid-march and it was summer period i believe? there was quite a queue to enter into the zoo, and when i managed to enter, i merely followed where the paths led me to
pathways were pretty narrow and considering the summer crowd, it was hard to walk around
enclosures were pretty average, animals were doing their thing, i was doing mine
except that for some popular animal attractions, where you had to squeeze your way to get in front or just skip it
after following the pathways to a few enclosures, i used the map to locate the animals/enclosures i havent visited yet
the panda enclosure works in a different way, you have to grab a special ticket somewhere near the entrance of the zoo (or something like that) in order for you to enter the enclosure to see the pandas
i snuck in without the ticket anyways cos (i had no idea & the entrance was waaay to far)
inside the enclosure, everyone had to stand in a queue and move in one direction along the viewing glass of the enclosures of the pandas
this means that each person would only have a maximum of 2-3 mins of visiting the pandas, and if they happened to be sleeping during that 2-3 mins of your precious time, welp, you just wasted all that queuing
luckily for me they were kind of active (playing with balls and eating bamboo etc)
another downside to this zoo was that they could not handle the crowd
as i was getting hungry walking about and stuff, the many convenience stores in the zoo had their shelves wiped of everything, i couldnt even get myself a bottle of water
i did like the fact that they had african elephants in a massive enclosure though
and the cheap admission fee is also a plus point
all in all, you get what you pay for



surprisingly large and boasting an interesting collection of local and international animals, this zoo is a place that could provide a day full of entertainment for even the youngest kids



worth a visit together with the gondola ride
its not easy to cram it up in a few hours unless you are walking really fast
lots of different animals, when we visited a lot of them were hiding because of the rains



went there a few times bringing my little nieces and nephews and it's an absolutely well planned zoo!go take a ride on the gondola







admission fee is less than us$2
probably one of the cheapest in the world
it is reasonably maintained
worth to visit especially those who have not seen panda


the taipei zoo is a big one in my opinion
comparing to the one i have previously visited
the variety of animals is quite big, from the ones from africa, australia, asia to the species from europe and antarctida
many caves were spacious and well preserved, but some of them were definitly too small for such big animals, like pandas or lions
so it was pretty sad experience to see them going around and around, looking pretty depressed
for a change the space of gorilla was so big that it was impossible to see the gorilla itself
to sum up in general the place is quite nice, the qighlight for us was the "bus" tak took us up for just 5 $nts and the places with good food where we could feed ourselves and wait for the rain to be gone
the biggest drawback for me was the places "underconstruction" like hippos and formosa bear places
it was an unique chance for me to see the formosa bear :( at least i sas panda!


if your are a tourist visiting taipei, then it's best you give this a pass
the zoo is worth visiting only if you have a day to kill in taipei
the animals are vast however there's nothing really worth to shout about
3 things worth visiting for: pandas, sun bears and penguins



a very big zoo
totally worth it given that the zoo has giant pandas and koalas
lots of various animal types
you can enter via the main gate or via the maokong cable car and ride up to the zoo south entrance
you can take a shuttle from there



the entrance fee is only ntd60 for adults
super cheap and inside is clean, big, the animals seem fine and its nice!!! good for kids
however, when i went there the brown bear was abit thing and sick
as for the panda it looks happy and cute!!


the panda house is very orderly (unlike beijing)
we went first thing
the cafe in the panda house had roaches
we will stick to the convenience stores in the park next time



walking around taipei zoo, one would notice that taiwan has really taken a lot of efforts making this facility top of its game
albeit, it can use more animals, but the animals appeared well-taken cared of



this zoo is large and the entrance fee is very cheap, only $60ntd
but i found there was something lacking
there wasn't that many people there when i went, i think because a storm was forecast in the afternoon
be prepared to do lots of walking as the animal enclosures are spread over a very large area and some enclosures didn't seem to have any animals in, maybe because of the heat or the typhoon that happened a week earlier? i feel that i didn't see as many animals as i was expecting as i spent more time walking than i did looking at animals
the bird area was my favourite place because the were free roaming birds flying everywhere
i've been thinking hard about my rating for this zoo and came up with the 3 stars based on the price of the ticket, because it is very cheap compared with other zoos that i've visited



large compound, cheap ticket prices of nt60 per adult
was very rainy due to the impending typhoon soudelor and dropped by since we couldn't take the maokong gondola
one of the two pandas was asleep unfortunately
this zoo has some interesting creatures like camels
left after a short while as it was too cumbersome to walk around in the rain



the taipei zoo is definitely worth the visit if you're spending any length of time in taipei
there are animals here, such as pandas and pangolins, which are hard to find at most other zoos
be warned though, unless you go midweek, there will be a line up to see the pandas
in terms of walkability, this is indeed a large zoo, but it's no less manageable than the london zoo or the toronto zoo
in any case, there is a little train that visitors can hop on and off to get around if mobility is an issue
the biggest selling point for me, however, is the price of admission
at 60 ntd (roughly $2 usd) you're getting into a world class institution at a fraction of the price you'd pay in north america or europe
it's worth the visit just for that alone!


a great zoo, well organised
make sure you check the weather before you go because if you run into a torrential downpour, your day would be ruined
suggestion: take the mrt and follow the sings to the gondola
take the gondola to the first stop, and from there take the shuttle to the zoo



children love zoo, but this zoo is rather too big for young children to walk around and the trams are a far walk to get to
the exhibits are quite far away from each other
other than the pandas, i am not impressed



its nice to be there
interesting way of keeping the animals inside 
i recommend you if you are visiting



we actually did not spend too much time at the zoo
we enjoyed the pandas exhibit which was indoors
we have been to the toronto zoo and the san diego zoo, so this is not quite on par with those zoos



interesting zoo featuring a fantastic aquarium
nice inside terrace restaurant with view on the aquarium
as thezsoo is big, free shuttle train is convenient



the zoo is very big! went at around 3pm++ and did not have time to explore finish every bit of the place



so impressed with the diversity of animals inside the zoo
a little disappointed though because the giant panda was sleeping when i visited
probably because it was a rainy afternoon



some parts of the zoo looked a bit unkept, but otherwise it was nice to see all the animals
a very big place though, it would take a few hours to see the whole place
my friend and i went late so didn't see the entire place
go earlier would be my advice



excellent zoo
just a week before i visited the shanghai zoo and what a relief this taipei zoo is


this is a nice park, spacious, with eye for the animals
nice one for an sunday afternoon (or whatever weekday)



great for families or couples date
avoid summer because of the heat and of course weekends because of the crowds
easy to get to by mrt and admission is fairly cheap (compared to others)it's no san diego zoo but it was a fun and memorable experience
check out the butterfly exhibit for sure!


taipei zoo was an amazing adventure for me
only 60twd and very easy access by air train
the variety of animals in this zoo is unbelievable
a full day is required to visit this beautiful zoo on a great landscape



while people who said 'the animals were in enclosures not cages' were technically correct, the 'enclosures' were often disappointing and lacked the authentic fauna we expected
the 2 american bison had an 'enclosure' big enough to play tennis in, but the hippo had an all cement (plus water) 'enclosure', and the penguins were in a white-painted-cement enclosure - did not see snow or real ice
it does not give off the appearance of a modern zoo
dont go on a hot day, the animals are inactive



i usually don't like zoos because the animals seem unhappy in captivity
but this zoo is awesome about making sure the enclosures provide hiding places for the animals
most animals are rescued and could not survive in the wild
the panda exhibit is great and the pandas seem to be having lots of fun



went there to see the pandas
there was 2 very lazy ones just showing off their back to you but was however nice to see them alive
the zoo has great variety of different animals, so in general a nice visit!


great zoo to visit especially for families with children
i recommend riding the train to the back of the zoo and walking back down
a must see exhibition is the panda! giraffes, zebras, elephants, reptiles, birds, most of the animals you'll find at the taipei zoo
gets too hot during the summertime, i suggest early fall and spring time to go since it's not so hot



huge zoo with reasonable price
it's situated beside the maokong gondola
i think most popular animal inside this zoo is panda



very good zoo with pandas to see
serves it's purpose
i recommend you take the tram up and walk down as the elevation is steep



the zoo is pretty big, it's very spread out so there are alot of walking, purposely went there to see the pandas and for the gondola ride but the gondola ride was closed for renovation so it was a big disappointment
overall it's like a typical zoo
i would visit if you have the time or if you are already there for the gondola but if not, don't bother making the trip



it seemed like the animals did not have enough space in this park
the pandas were the main reason we went here



as far as animals going, there's a huge range
the zoo is spread over such a huge area that it's physically draining to walk around
some animals are hard to spot and they sleep a lot but thats not their fault
wear sun cream and wear sensible shoes : that's my advice


this place is better for families
it's well located as it's just a stone's throw away from the train station
my only aim for coming there is to see the panda
the panda area has a dedicated facility and you have to fall in line in order to get your chance to see the panda in an enclosed glass space
you also won't be able to stay long as ushers will be telling you to move along so better take as many photos as you can



can be crowded at holiday time, but diverse range of animals and good facilities
better at cooler times of year


expect to walk far so plan accordingly with good shoes, refreshments etc
there are many areas that are spread far apart but it is signed well and the map is provided
to see the pandas you will be given a slot, usually just after when you arrive and it's busy inside so if you've seen them before then you might want to skip that section
the zoo is right next to maokong so you can combine your visit



this is one of the largest zoos in asia and the area is spread over a large plot of land on a hill
would suggest taking the maokong gondola up to maokong station first and spend some time there before taking the cable car back down to the taipei zoo south station
that way you will be walking down from the top of the zoo and will be less tiring
as i visited during the summer, temperatures were very very high and there is minimal shaded areas within the zoo
enclosures for the animals are huge too and most of the animals were just hiding away in the shade far away from view
might be better to visit during cooler months so the animals will be walking around their enclosures
overall a good visit
biggest plus point is the cheap entrances fees



wow, this place is cheap for the family
with the metro running to the gates nearly its at the end of the line, so you really can't get lost
the zoo has it all really, but don't miss the panda's
tips would only be prepared with good footwear, lots of water and sun screen in the summer, its a big hit with the kids


it was too hot
and sadly, everything from seeing the penguins to pandas were closed


but none the less, the staff there were extremely helpful



there is a lot of animals in the zoo
it was quite impressive ! the zoo is good for families because everything is in walking distance, it is possible to visit everything within one day
there is a restaurant near the entrance
despite that, ethically, i find the cages way too small for the animals



went early in the morning and followed suggested tips we got strollers and took the shuttle to the top then walked down but by 11 am it was already too hot even with all their mist coolers running
animals were all too hot to move
no air conditioned eating areas
on a cool day it may be a nice place to be
it's nice to see animals without cages at least
zoo is clean but a bit rundown
hopefully the construction will finish soon and new attractions open to rejuvenate the whole place



went one day with the kids
good for a few hours but lots of construction currently going on to improve
should be much nicer in a year or so



taipei zoo is not complete for zoo, cause not to much animals to see, but if you want see giant panda, taipei zoo is home place fo giant pandas



animal lovers will love this zoo
i wasn't expecting to see camels and koala bears, but i did! i really came for the pandas and it was a lot of fun to see them
save around five hours, if not the whole day, for this zoo
really worth visiting!


my first advise: do not go during summer time
the zoo is located in the last stop - wenhu line
it only costed me and my friends 60 ntd per person
we swiped our easycard(convenient - no need to wait)
honestly, it was my friend's birthday request to visit the zoo
it was not disappointing tho
except for the fact is was really hot and we were sweating all the way
there were animals that i have never seen before in my life such as puma, hyena, green mud horse, panda and even penguins
however, there are some cages without animals inside (disappointed)
there are souvenirs shop in various places and the prices were quiet reasonable
i bought some quite souvenirs for myself and also my friends and family
there are water fountains and also hand sanitizers at several places
parents does not have to worry about their children because of that



the zoo is divided into different sections and you probably need to spend an entire day to get through all the sections
you can also ride the gondola up and then walk down to visit the different sections
we went early on a weekday and it was surprisingly empty
a big zoo with an affordable (cheap) entrance fee
definitely worth a visit if you like animals!


loved this zoo
had a great time with my 21 month old 

she walked n tried to see almost all the animals
many fence were at her eye level
many areas to hide into to get ac or shade
was really humid so bring an umbrella, sunscreen or hat
panda bear line was long do expect lines



its the last stop on the wenhu line, which is quite a long train trip from where we were staying in ximen
the snakes weren't real
there are two pandas but they are behind glass in tiny enclosures and just look really sad



is good place for exercise with family, good price, if you felt tired you can take bus in very cheap price is like 5 taiwan dollar which is only 25 cent usd
people very nice, good experience


it is worth to bring your kids and spend a day there tog with maokong gondola
cheap admission tickets
convenient, a short 10mins walk from taipei zoo station
can juggle between taipei zoo and maokong


the zoo is big but does not have as many animals as expected
the design is cute, nice place for children
souvenir shops are nice to visit
only panda and penguin catch my interest
there are koala but they are sleeping so not much to see



first of all, the entry fee into the zoo is a mere $60tdw per adult/$30twd for child which is really affordable compared a lot of other zoos we've been to around the world
very easy to access from taipei zoo mrt (exit takes you directly there) or by the many buses which pass through and stop right in front
the zoo is built amongst mountains so it's surrounded by lots of trees and has a leafy feel to it
the zoo is clean and spread out with lots of different snacks and food on offer which is great; the prices are again very cheap eg
lemon tea $25twd, ice cream $60twd, hot dog $20twd
you can also bring your own drink bottle as there are lots of powered water stations around the zoo so you can re-fill with cold/hot water
they claim to be the largest zoo in asia and it does appear big with lots of exhibits, however we didn't get to see all the animals as a lot were in hiding (maybe from the hot humid conditions?); it would have been nice to see more than just 1 tiger/leopard/bear in its enclosure
a good idea to bring an umbrella for shade if you plan to walk around the whole zoo
there is also a tram service for $5twd one way which you may like to use if walking the whole day is too much work
overall, it was a pleasant trip to the zoo and whilst we weren't overwhelmed by the experience, we would recommend to anyone who has some free time or young families who want to check out the local zoo



this is a great zoo with a ton of things to see and do
price is dirt cheap, almost a crime how little you pay to get in
(~3 usd per adult, kids free)
food and drinks available and easy with a stroller



i went with my family and it was not as bad as we thought
there were quite plenty of different animals indeed
a nice place for family with children



if nothing else go to see the pandas, check you entry ticket to see your allotted time
the entrance fee is only 60 taiwan dollars, which is outrageously cheap
if you can get the gondola to the top of the zoo and walk down if its hot as that makes life a lot easier
there is a reasonable selection of animals, but the hotter it is the more likely that they're asleep
anyway just go and see the panda's if nothing else, you're unlikely to find it as easy and cheap to do so anywhere else in the world



the kids loved it
the panda attraction was fantastic as it was the first time they saw a live panda
be prepared to walk a lot, carry an umbrella of a hat
it was too hot!!


the zoo consists of at least 14 areas of animals from different parts of the world, such as formosan animals, insectarium, panda house, asian tropical rain forest animal, tropical rain forest, desert australian animal area ,african animal, bird world, antarctic penguins,etc
there are a lot of natural recreation routes and up hill roads, make sure you are in a pair of comfortable walking shoes
during raining season, the rain would be pouring for a good hour, so make sure you have rain coats with you during the summer
the zoo closes at 5pm everyday, so you want to be walking back to the entrance at least 10 minutes prior closing time, or be close to the zoo train so you can catch a ride back to the entrance



a very large facilities
a good place for small kids to run around
however, most of the place is dated


a great place to take your kids
just be aware that it's almost all outdoors and taipei can get very hot and humid during the summer



this is big zoo and people can feel tired while walking
there are strollers available on rent for kids
pandas have special section
it is located near mrt railway station
gondola (rope way) is also very near to the zoo, so if someone has full day to spend these two attractions are enough to make you tired


the taipei zoo houses some unique animals
probably the highlight of the zoo is the panda bear exhibit
other than that, expect to walk long distances between exhibits that may or may not have animals due to exhibit upgrades, renovations etc
the entry is very cheap, compared to other zoo entry tickets, about 2-3 usd per adult
as the zoo is built on an incline, i would recommend taking the gondola from the first zoo station up to maokong, and when you're done with maokong, take the gondola back down to the second zoo station, and from there visit the zoo downhill
it was very warm in summer, hence it wasn't a very comfortable experience



the zoo is huge, but walk-able on foot
the pandas are cute, but the rest may dispute
definitely worth the ticket fare, just to see the pandas and hares



the taipei zoo is located near the train station


could have taken a mrt ride from your hotel to the zoo
it has simple 'basics' animals in the zoo
recommended to take a tram up to the zoo and walk downwards


if the weather is good , the zoo will be a great place to be in
expected much but was a little disappointed



at only nt$60, there is seriously no better deal for zoo visit in the region! there is really a lot a lot of animals to see here - it is indeed a very large place
my highlight was the panda house which have 3 famous giant pandas - 2 adult pandas (tuan tuan and yuan yuan) and a young panda (yuanzai)
i realise it is better to come here on weekdays as they will let you stand and take photos or see the pandas freely when there is no crowd of visitors
there are also many other animals, including the alpaccas, camels, koalas, taiwan black bear, hippo, giraffes, elephants, pony, donkeys, flamingoes, leopard cat, malayan tapir, zebra, malayan sun bear, range of desert animals etc and even some domestic animals!note that on certain mondays, some animals are closed from public visiting



it is bang for money
twd60 for entrance ticket
you can see panda, koala, penguin, lion, tiger, snake, insect, bird, camel, horse, donkey, cow, leopard, pangolin, and etc



i spent almost 4 hours there even when the insect section was closed that day
certain section of the zoo are closed on every monday

taipei/my guide who fetch me from hotel on my last day told me it is better to take train to the end and walk from there back to exit
i told him i walk all the way up and only take train back down
he say it would be tiresome because it is ascending instead of descending



reasonable admission fees
they were very organised to distribute tickets to see the pandas so that the place would not be flooded with tourists


we liked the pandas the most





taipei zoo is quite big size wise
quite a lot of walking to do to see those animals in the zoo
it would be rather pleasant i could imagine in spring or autumn when the weather is cooler
unfornately, we visited in june so the weather was hot and humid
nevertheless, it was still a good visit as it was not crowded when we got there quite early at 9am on a sunday
not the best place to see pandas and penguins
we could only see 2 pandas and 2 penguins
the surrounding of zoo was well kept with lots of plants
toilet facilities were adequate and clean
we did not eat inside the zoo so we could not comment on their eateries



the animals mostly live in spacious modern habitats
the entrance fee is just 60 twd and 30 for students



if you are going during the warmer seasons, remember to bring along an umbrella and loads of water!i went during the colder seasons (feb) and was still perspiring as the zoo is huge! loads of area to cover as there are many sections to see and the terrain is a mixture of flatland and slopes
easily accessible by the local train service and the panda exhibition is not really worth the wait as the baby pandas are just behind the glass and ushers are quick to move the crowd



taipei zoo was awesome, seem like those animals were well taking care off at least compare to few zoo i visited before
panda, penguin and lots more species of animal you will able to see
spend nearly 5 hours in this zoo






it is a huge zoo with many sections: african, australian, asian



full of exotic animals, insects, plants


nice walking trails and gardens
you feel like you're in a real forest
u need more than 2 hours there, it closes at 5 so go earlier to enjoy and take pictures



we enjoyed this zoo very much
it is easy to get to via train
the zoo is undergoing renovation in some parts (the new home for some animals - i forget which ones - will open in two years time)
make sure you purchase mosquito repellant, the zoo sells this in the various shops dotted around the zoo
the asian rainforest was a highlight, and the african animals were great too
the australian animal section was a bit disappointing - don't know where the kangaroos are! the zoo entry fee is very reasonable and the zoo shop is good value too (compared to other zoos i have been to)
the zoo is well spread out, so recommend wearing comfortable walking shoes and bringing an umbrella or raincoat during the rainy season
alternatively, the zoo has a shuttle to help you get to the farther parts of the zoo more quickly



we felt a little bit disappointed when most of the animals were not seen in their respective cages
plus a lot of walking due to the huge park area



unfortunately the day i visited the zoo it was raining very hard
the zoo is an excellent value for the admission price; however, don't expect too much
it is quite small compared to other zoos in major cities
i was disappointed with the panda exhibit, as i expected more
you really don't need a lot of time to visit



went here a couple of weeks ago
the zoo is lovely! nice layout and design
great selection of animals! lovely day out! only cost 40nt to get it and right next to the mrt
don't bother with a tour



was expecting more from the panda house but i presume it could be the weather that i didn't really get to see them in actions
the zoo is a lot bigger than i expected, recommended half a day or more to spend
the selection of animals are plentiful and no doubt one of the best i have visited



all i wanted to do this time back was to see panda's in action
and luckly when we went, it was pooring rain
though walking around a zoo when buckets of water are coming down wasn't fun it made the panda line way short
no one was in line to see them which was awesome for us
we got to spend so much time with them without any rush or crowd
i guess in the summer time, the lines are crazy and annoying



a big zoo with lots of resting places and hence you can just take a short break when tried of walkingcool experience walking around as we went there in decemberbe prepared to spend at least a day there to ensure that the you have covered enough of the attractions


largest zoo in asia with a good variety of mammals, reptiles, insects from different continents
next to maokong gondola which unfortunately was closed when we visited
good for a half day family visit



after reading some reviews i was not sure what to expect
probably the worst
well it was very good
we went in at the south cable car entrance which was easier then staring at the main entrance
the animals are only in small numbers and in natural surroundings
not just concrete
they all look well cared for
easy to follow the map
everything is also in english
lots of refreshment outels and toilets
these were so clean especially with the large amount of visitors
the entrance fee was amazing 65 taiwan dollars included a one way shuttle
certainly a must visit


great experience
affordable entrance ticket
you need the whole day to explore the place
lots of animals to see



not much "wow" factor here
it's cozy and nice for people with little toddlers
they have strollers on load for a fee
they have insect garden
however, having been to singapore zoological garden, i'm not really amazed by it
it's neat for my toddler as there wasn't much thing to get his attention away
he can concentrate on viewing and observing the animals in his own pace



my purpose of the zoo trip was to visit the pandas
we able to get early ticket to enter the panda-rium
for me, the zoo was big and it located nearby with the metro station
the price for entrance was affordable or should say cheap
you can use easy card to access to the zoo w/o queuing for a ticket



in addition to the low cost entry to this zoo i love it has natural vegetation spread throughout
they have a good variety of local and international animals and the descriptions are in english and chinese
my favorite part about the zoo is the ongoing poop facts



very engaging and educational, great for children
tip: you can pay with your mrt card, if you have one
get ready to plan your trip around your visit to see the panda (you get a ticket when you arrive
)


nice place to spend a day with your kids
it's better to visit in spring or fall since summer is way too hot to walk in the zoo



i can spend a whole day here with only few bucks
i love all the animals inside and they have internal tram for lifting people up and down
it's really great experience



cheap, good location near mrt, have shuttle bus, various animals such as panda and penguin
i really love this zoo



i was impressed with the zoo
it is very easy to get to being the last stop on the metro
easy to find on the map since it is called the taipei zoo station
the zoo is a little hilly and pretty long
unlike a lot of zoo's where you can walk around in a circular fashion, the taipei zoo is set up in a linear fashion where you walk end to end and then back
zoo is clean, plenty of places to get snacks, and plenty of bathrooms
there is a tram that cost extra and you pay per segment so make sure it is going in the right direction before getting on
if you have the time, great place to relax, walk, and spend time with kids and the family



it was a fascinating trip for my family & i

it's like a bird park and zoo combined all at 1 affordable price
the pandas were the highlight of our trip n a definite must see!


it has to be one of the cheapest zoos in the world, its under some refurbishment but still good, and you can see pandas ! really easy to get too and great value for a few hours


we didn't get to see a lot of the exhibits, but the taipei zoo was a fun day trip and is great if you are looking for a day to walk around outside of the city
the formosa exhibits with native species were really interesting (the bears were very active)
the lemurs were also really great to see
and of course, we did the requisite panda watching which was great fun
(we went during the off season, so there were no crowds
)the enclosures are not the most modern, but they seem clean and comfortable and the animals appear to be well cared for and not overly stressed
(the penguins were not on display when we visited, so check to see if renovations are done before hiking up to see them
)if you want to make a full day of it, combining the zoo with the maokong gondola ride is a great option



if you want to see a wide range of animals at virtually no cost, this is the zoo to go to! while some of the enclosures are a bit depressing, they appear to be in the midst of extensive renovations and most animals are quite comfortable



we were not even originally planning to visit the zoo but last minute decided and i am so happy we did! such a big place with animals you get to see so close up
gorgeous environment for them and well taken care of



i've been to a couple of zoos and tend to have issues with all of them (no matter where you go, the animals seem too lonely and sad) and the taipei zoo was no different in that regard
however, they do have a large assortment of animals that i didn't expect to see (ex: grizzly bears!)
i went with the sole intention of looking at the pandas, but ended up walking around the rest of it as well and got to see some pretty neat things
note that there is usually a lineup for the pandas, but it's definitely worth it
the maps they give you are very easy to navigate, there are small food places throughout the zoo (there is also a mcdonald's at the main area near the front) and there are bathroom facilities everywhere
this is a very clean zoo
i was there on a weekday though (friday) and it was still pretty busy
i can only imagine what a weekend might be like, so try to go on a weekday if you can! to get here by mrt, take the brown line (line 1) to the end of the line and get off at 'taipei zoo' station



the zoo is super cheap and a fun afternoon, especially for those with kids
zoos aren't always my first choice attraction in a city, but this one had a good variety of animals including native taiwanese animals and pandas! we were most excited for the pandas, since you can't see them many places on earth
the facilities were well maintained, with nice gardens and easy access to restaurants and toilets
it's also easy to get here on the mrt and quite uncrowded on weekdays
a fun afternoon overall



rich species of animals can find here
good place to spend for a day, especially with kids
well manage, toilets and light meal easy to find



i love animals which make me feel like a child and natural
there are lots of different lovely animals here
i could take many photos and had loads of fun



ntd $60 for a full adult ticket and lots to offer in the zoo
pandas are the top favourite spot and can get a little crowded


nonetheless, love how the park is filled with trees so its pretty cooling to walk around
prepare to spend at least the whole day here to cover all the enclosure



wouldn't say i'm a zoo expert
been to la, san diego, and tokyo zoo
while the taipei zoo is not as pretty, it is well designed and you get to see everything close up
you don't need to walk forever, and it makes a great outing
highly recommend as something to do for families on a not too hot day



not a big fan of zoos usually bu i was forced to go due to my wife's insistence


however animals seem well looked after in good surroundings

they also a hada widevariety of animals


taipei zoo is accessible via mrt
suggest to go there at 9am, i think there are zoo shows
the zoo covers a lot of animals including insects but do not forget to prioritize the main attraction "panda"
suggest to ride maokong gondola after since it is just walking distance from the zoo
have lunch first at mcdo in the zoo or if you want street food, ride the maokong gondola till the last station



only one panda was just eating bamboo, and other animals was hiding or sleeping
not much fun
i only loved monkeys- a man was feeding them throwing food, and they catch! and they hold up their hands like saying 'hey, come on my food!' that's funny!


the zoo is so big and exciting! have a lot of shelters and most of the places is up hill
prepare insect repellent and cap
there is water cooler in every shelter



i was shock that for 2$ you could get to see the whole zoo
big zoo and really worth for what you pay


very well maintain and the entrance fees is really cheap 
only twd60 per person for adult 
last entree of the day at 4pm 
please come early and during weekday 
we went on mon afternoon and the no queue especially at koala and panda closure 
the koalas seems very well fed 
recommended for those who likes animals


i love this zoo on a weekday and fall/winter time
very spacious and great to take the entire family for a fun day out
the entrance fee is only usd2!!! recommend this place to families with kids


i visited this taipei zoo on november 2014
 its a great experience whereby i can see lots of animal like panda, koala, taiwan bear and more
its really worth since the entrance fee is only ntd60
more story please read http://www

com/2014/11/berbaloi-lawat-panda-di-zoo-taipei
html


unfortunately it was raining when we visited the zoo and we only managed to catch the koala and panda
the entrance fee was very economical for this zoo



the zoo is enormous and undergoing some work
i found the number of animals to be a bit disappointing and also had a bit of difficulty seeing them
but for once i was impressed with the zebras and giraffes
both groups have a lot of space to roam and exist in numbers that don't make one feel sad at their lone existences
there is a lot of walking to do here, but a train is available to take you to various ends of the mammoth zoo
an amazon rainforest is a highlight
i'd like to visit again when i have a full day to spend
or when the renovations are complete



well, after having been to the san diego zoo several times, it's hard to find many other zoos that can even come close
this is a small zoo and very inexpensive - children under 12 are free and adults are like $2
there really wasn't a whole lot to it, but the kids enjoyed walking around and seeing the different animals
the highlight was probably the gondola we took from the zoo to the tea house



my hometown is mucha, taiwan taipei wenshan, where the taipei zoo located
the other name of taipei zoo is mucha zoo
the mucha zoo was created the closest original habitat of animals, allowing visitors to better understand animals
therefore, there are a lot of people visit there everyday! when i walked by the public square in front of the mucha zoo, there usually crowded by families, teachers, students, even foreigners
everyone wanted to see the cute animals, such as panda and penguin!


we visited the zoo on a cool spring day and thoroughly enjoyed strolling around the various enclosures
it has a considerable range of wildlife and for the cheap price of a ticket, this is a must-see attraction
there are reasonable food options dotted around the park and it's all within twenty minutes of taipei by mrt



supper hot climate on a summer, zoo amenities and design are old fashion
hope that they can make it modern, visitor friendly and interactive



if you belief that zoos should be part of bribing up children, then taipei is one of the best i have visited - it was a very positive surprise
while close to the city, it is set in a green environment with lots of trees and space
while it is sad to see eg a single orangutan, the areas are quite spacious and where possible, different animals are kept together
there is a lot of focus on education and raising awareness, the path is well laid out and good to follow
we loved the rainforest
if you go with young children: bring a stroller (we only saw about 50% but walked in total of 3km!)
also take the "train" from the entrance to the top (penguin house) and back which is downhill
one negative: food is really bad (fast food / snacks only) so best bring food with you
overall a great visit and well recommended for children



this place is ideal for bringing kids
coupled with the winter cooling weather, it makes the entire day fun! the entrace fees is so low that put other zoos to shame
dont be deceived that low price means a lousy zoo
the zoo has wide variety of animals to view
kids can go all ga-ga over it
the tram service is also very useful to bring you from one end of the zoo to the other
dont miss out on this place



we went with our 3 year old son who was actually more interested in the train ride there than the animals there (he's not crazy about animals anyway)
it's the last stop on the brown line and if you ride the first car you can see the tracks, like the unmanned dlr trains in london
top tip
when you get there, take the $5 (exact change only or pay by your mrt travel card) per person "train" (cars pulled by a car that looks like a train) to the upper level and work your way down the hill back to the exit
sure beats going uphill andy hen having to come back down
the zoo is pretty large so it's a lot of walking, even for adults
the range of animals is pretty extensive



zoo is easy to get to on the metro and you can use your metro card to enter which is impressive
there is a time allocation for panda sighting- usually a 9 min window to reduce congestion
however disappointed as they only released 1 panda of the 3 and not much activity
i did appreciate the carers strategically placing bamboo to encourage the panda to get active
in general, the zoo is boring compared to the one at home here in aus
there is only 1 or 2 of every kind of animal, not active nor seemed too happy
however, well maintained gardens and plenty of bins which is a struggle everywhere else! spent about 40 mins here mostly to observe the panda



you have one leopard, one tiger, one panda, one tiny hippo, one very old orang utan all by themselves, they sure are lonely
a miss manage zoo that is trying very hard to reinvent itself
with all the constructions that are going on within the compound let's hope some improvements will bring upon better welfare for the animals



this is a very tourist friendly zoo
one of the better ones i have been to
it is very inexpensive to visit, under $2 usd per person
they have a large variety of animals in animal friendly settings
animals include hippos, rhinos, gorillas, giraffe, pandas, koalas, lions and many more
there is tram service to take you up or down the hills and a gondola for sight seeing from the mountains
there are plenty of places to eat
get there early if you are driving as parking lots fill quickly



the zoo had a great diversity of animals and birds
it was really awesome to see the pandas
most animals had a very natural and spacious living area
please be aware of the large size of the park
bring umbrella during sunny weathers



easily accessible place via mrt
cheap entry ticket
really cheap, and lot of animal
the animal appeared to be hibernating, probably due to cold weather? it was just the start of spring season when i visit the zoo
some area the animal are quite active
very big zoo, certain area are under going upgrade, guess they have plan to add in more variety of animal? lol
spend the whole morning from 11am-2pm
after which we proceed to makong gondola from the zoo



the zoo is clean and tourist friendly
they have several species of big cats and birds
biggest attractions are panda and koala
the reptiles species are the most exhaustive one i have witnessed
this remains my best visited zoo with my spouse till date
highly recommend



this zoo has a lovely layout and everything you might want to see
there are english versions of all the maps, etc so you can make sure you don't miss anything
it may be just because we went on a rainy day in march but there were no queues for anything
unlike other zoos i've been to, the food inside was reasonably priced and tasty too
very easy to get here as well and thoroughly enjoyed the half day we spent wandering around here



the taipei zoo is worth a visit - due to its size, it's at least a day's outing
it's conveniently located next to the taipei zoo mrt station
entrance fees can be paid by mrt card, and includes a timed visit to the panda exhibit (although the timing is not very strictly adhered to)
the zoo also has facilities for young children (diaper changing stations and hot/cold water dispensers)
there are also bus shuttle services within the zoo, which costs twd5 per person/ride, also payable by the mrt card
placed in various locations within the zoo are statues of the animals, which provide nice photo-taking opportunities for kids
nearby the zoo is the maokong gondola(cable car ride)
the bus shuttle also stops at the gondola station
if you have the time, the ride is also worth taking for the lovely mountain views



the zoo had some drawbacks, but is certainly worth a visit
the place is huge, with themed areas spread out well
it does follow a logical kind of order - you can work your way through the exhibits and catch the shuttle back down or vice versa
highlights for me were the asian rainforest area and the formosan area
the panda house was very disappointing (although we did not have to queue), the outdoor feeding of the panda was more enjoyable
some areas such as the penguin house, insectarium and australian sections were just a let down
some areas were clearly being upgraded and there is a large area being redeveloped
on the plus side, it was all incredibly clean
the toilets deserve a mention - not only well looked after, but if you have kids, super poo was very entertaining and educational and all the toilets have different information on excrement, which is actually a big deal for a zoo, when you think about it! there was plenty of english for westerners, which was a bonus
there are also plenty of food areas up the top of the zoo, not just the big one with the big name brand as you come in



the zoo is well planned and fairly easy to get around
clean facilities and good food readily available
the panda house was by far the highlight
inside area to wait turn to view with air
pandas were very active, so cute and seemed to be enjoying themselves
you did not get to stand in front linefor long but could see them on approach for quite a while
had a great time in the butterfly area also
they were attracted to our bright color and landed on us and
"chased" us
great videos!


nt60 for admission fee is totally worth to come
there are so many animals in the zoo which i have no time to see all
just a pity there is no any animal shows, otherwise will be prefect



taipei zoo had a variety of animals to see, spread out over a large area
many of the enclosures looked quite dated, however, several new spaces were being developed
the area is quite large, with plenty of walking between exhibits so make sure you are wearing suitable footwear
you can get a shuttle within the zoo from one end to the other for $5nt
we visited during the week and the zoo was relatively quiet, however, friends inform us it is very busy on weekends
overall, this was a pleasant zoo to visit but nothing standout



very nice zoo
the panda exhibit is awesome
we went on a monday but saw the crowds on saturday
if possible, don't go on the weekend



very large zoo, but well layed out, easy to get around
the zoo is easily accessible by mrt
entrance fee is very low, only 60 $nt for adults
a lot of the animal exhibits only have one or two animals, even the ones that would normally be in larger groups such as bison, zebra, elephants, otter, etc
the enclosures for the elephants and hippos were just bare concrete, with no vegetation
there is a new hippopotamus enclosure being built, hope it offers more for the animal
it is easy to get around the park, there are even shuttle trains to go from one end to another, or to the maokong gondola which has stations at the entrance and far end of the zoo
there are better zoos around the world, and certainly much worse ones
so i would say that taipei zoo is about average



if ur fan of the zoo, u should go
a good selection of animals to spread the park
they also have bird cage which create the living enviornment for those bird
we can walk inside freely to observe and see some
bird flying pass us
and the butterfly section is
another spotlight to walk through
overall, taiwan is one of the most species country to have different butterflies
as well for the new addition panda and koala, u can spead the whole day here without boredness
besides, it is easy access by mrt
highly recommend!!


taipei's zoo is a very nice zoo
i think the best time to go would be in march - may/june time frame and maybe after september


otherwise walking around in the heat is just not fun



went there in weekday, not crowded
the price was very very cheap
cost ntw 60 only for adult


for 60nt for adults and free for small kids, taipei zoo is comprehensive in terms of animal collections
it is very good to teach kids about animals that they only see in tv
clean place, food shops are strategically located in the whole zoo, not to mention vendo machines for drinks and snacks
really a zoo for kids and kids at heart


enjoyed our day out at the zoo
there aren't too many places where you get to see a baby panda up close
it was a little wet which kept the temperature and the crowds down but actually made the experience more enjoyable
as i'm old enough to remember the old taipei zoo, across the river from the grand hotel, i had a fairly negative idea in my head of what the zoo might be like and i can confirm that for the most part the condition of and environment for the animals is leagues away from that



lack of maintenance, lack of clean toilet faclity and similar to other taiwan places very dirty and smelly-


this is one of the few zoos where the animals are not sleeping all the time
the place is very clean for both the animals and the visitors
it is well maintained



this well maintained zoo has a lot of greenery
very similar to other zoos but the point of difference in that the enclosures are spacious and clean and the animals are all active
the icing on the cake are the pandas



undoubtedly very affordable ticket to see animals from most continents in a number of sections but just beware don't ever wear short pants during the summer or your exposed body parts especially legs will get bitten by the tiny blood-suckers and end up unbearable itchy and keep scratching like mad! oh yes i've seen an ultra short pants pretty young girl keep scratching her legs which is very embarrass
mark my words!


i really liked this zoo
we were only there for a few hours, but i felt like we saw a lot and the animals felt close and active
it's quite a large zoo, but felt very manageable
have you ever been to the san diego zoo - that one is way too large
this one is also quite large, but didn't feel so tired walking it
and it seemed like exhibits were close to each other
so there aren't long treks of walking without seeing anything
the children's zoo is really quite fun
i wish we had more time
i think you have to grab tickets early for the panda exhibit
we were too late
i don't think it was for extra money, just to control the number of people in and out of the panda exhibit



lot of trees inside and well maintained
my kid enjoyed the visit throughout :)very similar to other zoo, the only exception is panda!!


i try to go at least once a week, during the week
i just love the pandas and during the week it is the best
more quiet, nice to walk around, fresh air
i just wish they would carry on with the new home for the hippos this development seems to have stopped unfortunately
combine with maokong visit



for a zoo that is a hair over a century year old, this zoo is a magnificent place to spend the day
while it is obvious that this is a very old zoo, much care has been taken to keep it really very well maintained
the animals here are well kept and looked after even with the surprisingly cheap entrance fees



" a great place for a day out, well planed, clean, well organized
many places to purchase drinks and food



we went here in the morning, wanting to see a lot of thing in this huge zoo
when we entered and we went to the first animal , he was sleeping and hiding
we thaught that it was because of the hour , it was the morning so why not
but it was definitely the case for the vast majority 


or there are some we never managed to find


only the otters seemed happy to be there
it was really funny to see them enjoying their time in the water
so this zoo can be really a beautiful place , but it's not totally the case for the moment
we still had 6 hours here, because there is so many things to see !


it was not difficult to find the place as its right next to train station
it was drizzling slightly when i was there but we were prepared with raincoats
there are some vendors who will try to sell you umbrellas and other stuff, but they are not pushy
the entrant fees are very affordable and the park size is ok for a 4 four visit
the star attraction is the panda exhibit which we were given tickets fir a specified timing
took us a good 20 mins to reach the exhibit and after a quick
walk through, we were off to check out the other animals
the place looks like they can do with some upgrading as some exhibits looked tired and some are eerily empty
however, i think the star find for me was the koalas exhibit as i did not expect to see them in taipei
we were given a brief introduction but the staff and was interesting and not overwhelming
the koalas are placed into two
different enclosures according to gender and they looked really cute even though most were sleeping
its a good place to go and relax in nature after all the buzz in downtown taipei but don't expect too much



the taipei zoo has allot to offer, and you should expect lines to see the panda's
there is plenty to see, and heat of the day should be considered
the gondola ride to the zoo also provides great views and photography opportunities
happy zoo day :-)exploretraveler

i love the design of the zoo
the entrance with many animals drawings which are very cute indeed
we took about 40 mins from city centre to the zoo, all the way we took the metro
inside the design is user friendly
you should tried the train there
many animals inside, including zebras, lions, monkeys, elephants, tigers etc
very large inside
i spent about 5 hours there



i've gone to a few zoos over the years, this zoo has a lot of variety and natural flow to it, although the animals/creatures/insects are mostly placed a safe distance away patrons
very well priced/value for your dollar
close to the mrt station



came here for the pandas and the penguins, but sadly the exhibit for the latter is closed
otherwise, a great and educational place to spend the day
there's plenty to see and learn about animals while you are here, and the animals themselves were in excellent condition
especially loved all the little touches they had with small text boxes and sections located near the exhibits, designed to inform and entertain



we had a great time in this zoo, and the panda exhibit was especially good
we went during feeding time and everyone stuck to a nice queue so we all go to see them eating up close
some parts are undergoing major redevelopment works, but it is already an excellent facility with large and natural environments for all the animals



went there for the pandas and was not disappointed!it's a pretty big zoo, and it was drizzling when we went there, so there wasn't a crowd
overall pleasant :)


i have seen a lot of better zoos

somehow, i thought the place was understaffed
not a huge variety of animals too
avoid unless you are bored



i only visited this zoo to see the pandas
i received a waiting number after i went in (about an hour later) and just walked around seeing the other animals
i only went to see the pandas so i was excited when it was my time
the one panda was outside pacing back and forth while the other panda was inside eating and resting
there is a baby panda but i didn't see that one
it is worth seeing if you are a panda lover but an average zoo otherwise



taipei zoo is great value for money for what you get- no doubt at all! it's very spacious and the exhibits are a good size for the animals
there were a couple that were a bit small i thought but they were temporary ones while new exhibits are being developed
the one real let down was the panda exhibit
you get a ticket to enter it with an allocated time when you enter the zoo
it was so jam packed with people and the employees kept waving us forward that when we did get to the viewing windows we didn't get a chance to stand and observe
people love pandas i suppose! there is no queuing like this at any other displays so that is good
after the zoo you can catch a shuttle bus to the maokong gondola station which was a great experience
the zoo is easily accessible by wheelchair but there are a few hills/inclines so be prepared
if you have average fitness it would be no problem with wheelchairs or prams though
plenty of vending machines, food shops, and toilets throughout the zoo too which was handy
overall i highly recommend this zoo, great value for money!


although there is construction currently happening at the zoo, i enjoyed my time here
the bird exhibit was impressive
the taipei zoo has large enclosures with plenty of space for the animals
it is a good place to walk around and see the animals
there is a tram, which i did not take
my only disappointment was the penguin house was closed



masive zoo with well kept animals
some construction going on but not too bad, the pandas are awesome
you get a specific time you enter the zoo to see the pandas



admittedly, it's been a while since i was last at a zoo
but i recall there being a couple of sad looking animals in too-small pens each
the taipei zoo had hordes of animals and lots of space
we were transfixed by the 8 giraffes and a pack of zebras
and of course, the pandas
when you buy your ticket, make sure to mention you want to see the pandas and they'll give you a time window for entering the panda house



it is really cheap with only ntd60 for admission and you can see panda here!! although there are a lot of improvements to go, i was fully enjoy my half morning to be spent here



i think this is a nice zoo, as zoo's go
i think there ought to be better enclosures though
i felt the elephants would be better off in a different setting
i don't think they care for concrete floors
they looked a little under stimulated
same thing with the pandas and tigers
not enough room to enjoy life



i feel very sad to think back to the dirty and small conditions of some of the animal exhibits at taipei zoo
part of me wants you to visit so the cheap nt60 helps to contribute towards the zoo and naive me thinks it will help the animals
the zoo lacks everything that all the established and great zoos have such as london zoo and singapore zoo
but it has a lot of animals and covers so many animals it will take you a whole day to see it all
like those expensive well known zoos, it should have expensive entrance fees, souvenirs, cafes, restaurants and offer lots of different gimmicks and offers and packages
you get instead, cheap food, cheap souvenirs, a convenience store where people sit outside with instant noodles and fish balls
the place is so worn down and in need of tlc
just hope it gets the cash injection and management and business plan to improve it soon



this is a very small zoo, but the cost to get in is the equivalent of $2 usd, for the price it's a great value
the absolute highlight are the pandas
we were fortunate that the day was not busy and we only had to wait a few minutes to see them
one was up close to the glass and sat up and yawned while we watched
very cool!another highlight was the koalas which i had not seen in a zoo before



the zoo is in the process of building several new exhibits and some of the animals are sharing habitats until it's done
the panda exhibit was nice and not as crowded as we expected
i'm not much of a zoo goer, but i'd definitely visit again once the new exhibits are finished



i was surprised how cheap it was to go into taipei zoo
it was my first time
i really enjoyed it, even though there were many tourists there and you had to line up to see the pandas, it was great fun taking my god son there he really enjoyed it too
i would recommend it as it's very cheap and a good activity for the whole day =)


the zoo is very big and pretty
however the places where they have the animals are very small
is sad that they have more space for people to walk than for animals to live
but it is a beautiful place
there's a train inside that will take you from one place to another in the zoo and you can also take the gondolas inside the zoo



pro: cheap entrance ticket, 30 twd for adult and kids under 12 are free, panda cons: too far from one exhibit to another, avoid going in the summer


not many zoos have panda's, so took the opportunity to take my two boys to see them at the zoo
got there for the opening at 9am, very few people around but a large number of school groups starting to congregate
jagged early tickets to see the pandas - essentially got to go straight there, only a dozen or so other people were there so plenty of time to see the pandas without being rushed
the rest of the zoo is a mix of quite nice enclosures and some really crappy ones
seems like they are spending some money though as two large refurbishments were underway
large range of animals, plenty to keep young children entertained for several hours, be prepared for lots of walking
incredibly cheap day out
only 30 ntd for children to get in - that's the price of a snickers bar at the 7-11!after the zoo we raced up to the gondola to finish the day off
good combination



get there early to beat the crowds (there will be hordes of them by 11am)
the panda exhibit is the crown jewel, but don't miss out on the other exhibits too
the enclosures are spacious for the animals, but give viewers an opportunity to get reasonably close for optimal viewing
you can visit the entire park in about 3 hours if you chose not to dottle



like - lots of animals , - clean - has wheelchair and stroller facilities
- accessible via public transport
dislike - limited food choices



im not usually a zoogoer but went with some people i met and it was very nice
pretty big id say and with many different animals


i love this place!the prices were cheap/affordable and you get to see a big zoo!(although the walking made me really really tired)


i do suggest though you come here around 10 am because i dint see three attractions and some animals because i arrived at 1pm and they closed at 5pm
(like what i said really big so be early, your gonna need the whole day)


if you have been to the zoo in singapore, chicago or busch gardens (us), you cannot use this as your baseline expectation or you will be disappointed
the zoo is old, and the facilities are clearly outdated
not sure about the animal treatment
however, our children (9, 7, 5) had a blast, and do not care about the quality of the facilities
they just want to see animals, and there were plenty! note to westerners with children: there is a mcdonalds right by the entrance



great day, great zoo, loved the place
plenty of animals to see and it is surprising cheap



there is value to going on off-days
we went the tuesday after holiday travel season, and early in the morning (10 am)
this meant that we didn't have to wait to see the pandas at all, even though they will normally assign you to a timeslot
the koalas were adorable and numerous
(this zoo is so incredibly cheap [60 ntd! for pandas and koalas and real bears too!] and well-integrated into the city: easy access from the subway, you can pay admission and the in-park trolley with your easycard)the poo-blic art is unabashed and hilarious
if you're offended by stylized colorful piles of dung, i'd avoid
the only slight disappointment was that the penguin house was closed, and not announced on the website, which also doesn't seem to be updated that frequently
maybe call ahead if there's anything you're really set on seeing



can spend the whole day there
food and toilets are just around the corner
good verity of animals
reasonable entrance fee



so many animals to see
we were ushered through the giant panda place a bit quickly but otherwise very nice



its a nice zoo and we enjoyed strolling and seeing all the different animals
the zoo is maintained fairly well
very accessible by public transport and you can take the gondola as well
i would suggest this if you have kids and want to spend the day there



while on business in taipei i fell upon a day off on a thursday and decided to head to the taipei zoo with my business partner
we hopped in a cab and took a 30 minute ride to the zoo
cab was just $9 us
(you can pretty much go anywhere in taipei by cab for a great price)
the cost to get in the zoo was less than $2
they had a good amount of animals, and some panda and koalas which we don't commonly see in the us
the butterfly house was just loaded with pretty butterflies
there was not much in the way of entertainment and shows
while strolling the zoo we realized that we could take a quick bus ride to get to the gondola station which takes you by cable car to the top of the tea mountain
a scenic glass bottom gondola ride which was very smooth
once at the top you can hike down the mauntain side, sip tea, have lunch and visit some beautiful bhudist temples
i had previously been to the tea mountain hiking, but i had never put together that you could go to the zoo and access this at the same time
this was a very reasonably priced day out
i must have spent less than $30 for the whole day's entertainment, dining and leisure
in chicago that's a 15 minute cab ride
add the taipe zoo to your list if time allows while visiting taiwan



like most people you go for the panda's
yes they are incredibly beautiful and who would pass an opportunity to see them for real
but, it seems they are the only animals here that are well looked after
particularly sad are the elephants who do nothing but stand still together and the 9 hippopotamus who were cramped into a tiny enclosure with no water
penguin enclosure was closed and most of the animals were inside and nowhere to be seen
the rainforest walk could have been really nice, but again we saw very few animals
we eventually gave up on this attraction more because of the condition of the animals we saw rather than the lack of



i loved this zoo when i visited the zoo 3 years ago for the first time
but unfortunately, i do not feel the same way
they have some reconstructions going on and closed some exhibitions like the penguin house
they added a lot of resource to the panda house
and i hope that they can do the same for the well being of other animal like mongolian horses
i saw one with bad legs that can hardly stand and walk
the people felt very bad that the horse is suffering



this is the first time we visited this zoo
we were very impressed by the vast variety of animals they kept there - llama, camels, koala bears, penguins, pandas, red pandas, etc
the zoo was also huge, we were so tired when we walked to the other end of the zoo so we took the tram back



visited after maokong gondola ride
entrance only nt$60 per adult, inclusive of one time visit of pandas within its educational enclosure
however, still can view them outside next to the enclosure
the zoo is huge and covers a wide area
many varieties of healthy animals to see
lots of walking if intend to explore all and may need at least 3 - 4 hours
wheelchair friendly



we went to zoo for panda, my boys loved it
it is a big zoo, but they have strollers available for hire
we arrived early, and spend the morning there


it got very busy late in the morning





plenty of interesting stuff to look at and laid out quite well
nice cafe with plenty of choice
got busy after a while with the local schools on visits
everything was explained in english which was handy for us



visited the taipei zoo on the 17th nov, their main attraction is their pandas (tuan tuan & yuan yuan)
there were different types of animals there, however, it appears quite old and poorly maintained
the animals are mostly alone and they do looks sad at times
hope that they can at least pair them up so that they don't look so lonely
there were guinea pigs under the children section but it's alarming to see that they did not do enough research or knowledge on them
what i saw with my fiancee is that the guinea pigs were placed together with rabbits which is a no-no as the rabbits might pose a danger or injure the guinea pigs when they got excited and kick using their hind legs
i seriously hope the zoo management or zookeeper will do something about it
otherwise, just average
nothing special



went there with our 3 year old in december 2013
 its a very well designed zoo and we stayed all afternoon (our kid was having her afternoon nap)
our kid loved the lemurs and yes she was singing "i like to move it move it" non stop after visiting them
its quite a big zoo so better hire the light stroller at the visitor centre near the front entrance if travelling with kid



started to rain one morning so thought we would check the zoo out, there was hardly anyone there which was a bonus, some enclosures are a bit small for the animals but was surprised at the variety they had here, gardens were very nice as well


you need a day there
half day in the zoo walk around, the other take the cable car up in the hill, was nice up there in the mountain



the panda house was awesome! three were out and playing the entire time we were there
the formosan exhibit is fascinating
they take visa everywhere but get cash in the city if you want it--only unreliable bank machine encountered was here



panda is the highlightalso do not forget to visit the reptilia kingdom
you need to spare 1 day to explore the zoo



pretty amazed with the zoo considering entrance fee was cheap
it's huge with lots of animals to see
the animals had good space to move around and were very lively compared to other zoos we have seen
quite an unforgettable experience for us and our 2 year old



the main star of the zoo when i went was the (relatively) newly born panda cub
unfortunately, pandas are pretty fickle, and they aren't terribly photogenic
the staff pushes you along so people in the back can move into the exhibit
we got lucky and got a nice shot of the cub and the mother, but cross your fingers that they feel photogenic when you visit
the rest of the zoo was nice as well; fairly standard assortment of animals, with a lot of chinese/taiwan specific species as well



it's a place to visit if you like pandas
much cheaper than what we singapore zoo!! nice park to relax & ride the cable car up to mao kong






our main visit to zoo the is to see the pandas
it cheaper too
but the distance to the zoo is pretty far
when we reached and queue to see the pandas
all of them are sleeping
worse part is the security will keep asking you to move on dont block those visitors behind
so quickly you need to snap pictures of the pandas facing their back
what i really hate is the security
push visitors to move on dont block but hey we are here to see pandas right? and if i have seen them before i wont travel all the way there to catch a glimpse


the zoo was bigger than i thought it would be and so inexpensive
the train goes right there
the pandas are a must see and if you finish with the zoo early the gondola is close by



lovely day out, incredibly cheap when compared to zoo's in the uk
get a packed lunch from one of the vendors outside to save a bit more money
you can get drinks inside
best thing is to get the train to the top of the zoo, which i think is about $50nt
then start at the penguins (yes, in taiwan) and work your way down the hill
it's much easier than walking up
it has everything you would want from a zoo, good variety of animals and of course the pandas
i must have been here about 5 times with the kids but it has changed each time with new features at the bottom, lilly ponds and water fountains
nice day out



visit my lovely koala and panda in taiwan parkthey are lovely ~~


pretty zoo with wonderful animals like in a picture landscape
only the queue at the panda visit was disappointing
didn't manage to see any panda after the long wait

however overall still fine 



this is one of the cheap zoo to explore
is good for kids as they can really see various type of animal
the fun one was the panda



this zoo is huge
it can take you a good day if you are going to go there with your kids and see all the animals
if you want to see the panda, go in with the mindset that you have to queue up
so, avoid school holidays
this place gets a lot of tourists from china as well
entry fees are not too bad and you dont have to queue up if you have the subway pay as you go card
try it out
souvenirs and food (macdonalds) are outrageously expensive



zoo was bigger than i thought and my family spend 5 hours walking the whole grounds despite the some of the major exhibits closed for renovation
entrance fee was paid using the easy card



i don't see staff within the zoo to guide us where to go
signage unclear
not much animals to see except panda & koala
waste of money & time



take the mrt to the last stop
zoo are family friendly, fun and well organized
avoid going during the weekend or holidays as it gets very crowded



we were pleasently surprised with the zoo in taipei
while the crampness of taipei city was getting a bit much we found solace amongst the koalas
each of their exhibits had plenty of information and were modern
i was expecting some lower standards of care for the animals, but they didnt appear to be maltreated at all
and the koalas seemed to be living quite nice in their newer building
the closeness to the gondola was also a good 2 for 1 stop off the metro



parts of the zoo are under construction, some exhibits were closed (panda bears, penguins), directions to different areas not clear or well-marked, very crowded



admission is certainly cheap
the zoo is well organised in terms of set out
queuing up to see the two pandas was a waste of time compared to the beijing zoo pandas
the best zoo i've seen recently is in south korea
much better than this one and better than the zoo in singapore



went to this on the way back from the maokong gondola, so went through the south entrance
the best bit was the panda!! they were hilarious! and well worth the visit
some of the enclosure are a little on the small side but still had a good time



we were not expecting much after paying entry fee of nt60 per adult
it is so affordable!!! but, we were pleasantly surprised to see gorillas, koala bears and camels in this zoo
a lovely place to visit
my family had an enjoyable time here



located only a stone away from the taipei metro taipei zoo station, a tip of the wenshan line, it is very convenient to bring kids to the taipei zoo
it is relatively very affordable, only nt 60 per adult and nt 30 per child
the most famous attraction is the pandas, and there's no additional charge
right after the visit to taipei zoo, stop by just a few steps more at the maokong gondola to see a panoramic view of taipei through its mountainous higher ground



spent a rainy, miserable day here recently and had a lovely time
the zoo is split in to sections and no one animal has priority (bar maybe the pandas)
it's a large place with all manner of animal and some nice surprises along the way
the insect house was especially quiet and although not hugely impressive was interesting for the butterflies alone
could easily spend a day here come rain or shine



i liked the nearby tram, which travels a long distance up the mountains and through the canyons giving the traveler a panoramic view of taipei



am really impressed that their zoo is so cheap compared to singapore zoo
only 60 for adult and 30 for children
wasn't expecting much but turned out there's quite a number of animals on display which are not available in singapore
like koala bears, gorillas, hyenas and many more
there's ample space to see the animals and there's many of them on display
not just two or thress of each
there's no additional charges to see the panda display as well
when you mention zoo, they really tried to include all the land, air and sea animals
so you get to see most in one place
they have catered a separate section for birds, fishes and insects
unlike in singapore, you must visit the bird park and sea aquarium in another place to see these animals and insects
i like the way they display the animals where you can get up close to take pictures with them while being protected by the glass panel



the taipei zoo is an affordable visit for the entire family! the admission is only nt40 (i think), and you can have your meals from the macdonalds or get a bento from the 7-eleven
be sure to put on some sunblock as the place is quite open and it was really hot when we visited
there are lots of places to refill your water bottles too!if you don't feel like walking, just take the train to the station - there's only 2 stations (one near the entrance, and one near the middle of the zoo)
couple your visit with a visit to maokong via the maokong gondola
you can take the zoo train to the maokong gondola station (re-entry possible)
finish your day with a visit to the teahouses at maokong for a relaxing and enjoyable day!


well maintain zoo and cheap
only cost twd 180 for 2 adults and 2 kids
easily navigates the attraction
asian, africian, european and local taiwan rare species available
no additional cost to visit the panda centre unlike other countries
good places for family trip
spent at least half day
easily reached with taipei mrt



a great place to know beautiful animals (i recommend koalas and penguins)
you can take good pics at the main door, there's three funny monkeys
easy arrive by mrt



really surprised when visit taipei zoo as their price for adult is at nt60 and kid at nt30
worth a visit if you have time to spare, children will like it!!


they were behind glass, and the long line was kept moving by grumpy guards but got a few good pics
great place to get the atmosphere of the city on a sunday afternoon


the entrance fees are not expensive like the one we have here in singapore
we were on the maokong gondola and alighted at the taipei zoo (south) station and went in
entrance fees are cheap
the trams will take you to the center of the zoo where you can walk around to see the animals
the main attraction were the pandas and it's a 10 min walk to the where they are at from the center of the zoo
or you can pay twd5 to take the tram to the entrance and the pandas are 3 mins via foot
do make sure that your cameras are ready to capture the pandas as the guides will make sure that the line is constantly moving to avoid human congestion
more so during the closing hours as that's when most will catch a glimpse of the pandas before they leave the zoo



we went there straight at around noon time after our maokong tour
the zoo was very big and alot of walking in order to visit to one animal den
due to raining, we did not manage to visit their penguin as it was all the way to the top and our jelly leg was screaming to rest
in the end we rested at one of the eatery with lots of birds sitting at the roof top



you can visit the taipei zoo and you will have a great time but compared to other zoos around the globe this isnt something special
the enclosure could be larger; for an european it was in the beginning quite confusing where to go



didn't plan on coming to the taipei zoo, but on the way down from tea tasting in maokong we decided we should see some pandas
we barely made it in before the gates shut, and only had about an hour to explore
however in that time what we saw was great
the zoo is laid out very well and has some great animals to see
we only managed to see a fraction of the zoo but that piece was amazing
the obvious highlight was watching two pandas run, roll, climb, and wrestle all over the outside exhibit
wish we had more time here



this is one of my favorite zoos in the world
it is large, so you could end up walking a lot, but they have some terrific exhibits
the gibbons are always a winner, as are the aviaries
i probably just got lucky, but the pandas i saw here were the most active and playful pandas i've ever seen
if you are lucky you might get to see them feed some enormous crocodiles - 18 feet long!


i have been to numerous zoos and have to say that i was pleasantly surprised at this zoo
first thing is it is right on the mrt like and very easy to get to so that is a bonus
second is that it is not expensive at all
it was 60ntd ($2
50usd) and you can stay all day
it is a large zoo and we decided to take the "train" to get to the other side of the zoo and walk back to the entrance
it is a very good idea because after just walking back i was tired so i couldn't imagine walking there and back
there are a lot of animals that you wouldn't expect over here, like pandas, pink flamingos, hippos, elephants, lions, camels etc



the zoo is laid out in a fun and creative way, they have an area that has hippo statues outside of the hippo area, that look like they are in the water, kids seemed to be having a great time taking pictures on them and playing on them
there was a giant poo that people could take pictures in (it was outside the bathroom close to the mcdonalds)
my favorite area was area with the monkeys and horses
it was very kid friendly
my only negative thing was that the amphibian exhibit was closed and we couldn't go in
i always like the snakes and fish and whatnot



not sure if it was the little bit of rain or long trip out there, but the taipei zoo just didn't live up to expectations based on what others have said
i have many friends and family here in taipei and koahsiung and just didn't find the zoo to be what it was built up to be
still, kids will enjoy it to some extent and it's not all that bad
just temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it no doubt



entrance to taipei zoo is very cheap
only 60 ntd but it is so worth it
its huge, clean peaceful w healthy animals
lots of nice shady areas to rest and eat
best way to get there is via train



bring your kids!!! nothing to dislike about the zoo! it's too clean! try the icy sandwich and just sit and watch the animals
best feeling in the world!


taipei zoo is a good place for everone to visitand the entrance fee is very cheap ~~the zoo is full of many animals i am loving it~~


we spent a day out in taipei zoo
very nice to walk around
the panda hall is a must-see
good to go in weekdays and there were not many people there
some areas are a bit uphill and is good exercise
when tired to walk back, we took the tramway to return to the main entrance
there were not many nice place for eating, only some kiosks for drinks and a macdonald at main entrance



visited the taipei zoo, arrived there by the mrt starting at taipei central station, we asked directions and with map in hand, my husband and i managed to find the ticket box by the tix($4) each for a return trip
on the platform, we checked we had the right line by asking, people will help
not all taiwanese speak english but hey will try and help by finding someone who does
train arrives, this is done in some orderly fashion
not as rigid as japan but waiting lines are painted on the station so people do wait within the lines
the trains are excellent, they arrive on time and there is limited waiting periods
the doors open and you expect people to wait to let the passengers out, but there is a mish mash of passengers getting on and off
definitely not like japan
once on the trains are beautifully clean and air conditioned
taipei is coming into winter but it was 25 degrees and the taiwanese must think it's cold they are all in long sleeves and coats
anyway our train journey commences and we get of at daan station and transfer to the taipei zoo line
very smooth process
once at the zoo a very cheap entrance fee is charged of $4 per person, the zoo is very large and lush with vegetation, it requires a lot of walking, very pleasant surroundings
filled with school children we walked around the zoo, not a lot of animals, but the highlight was the panda and the exhibition
two elephants but lots of one off animals, who normally you see in two's or family groups
nice herd of zebras an assortment of unique birds
best to take the $5 ntd train up to the higher parts of the zoo unless you are prepared for a hike
all up it was a pleasant experience
not many food outlets all i saw was mcdonalds, but plenty of drink vending machines
my husband and i were there for about 3 hours and felt that we saw most things
wear good walking shoes, light clothing, take an umbrella(sun and rain) 



this zoo is very large and its uphill so best to ride the train to the end of the zoo and then walk your way down
the panda visit is controlled and can only be visited once, the ticket is given upon entrance to the zoo
there are plenty of animals to be seen (especially the panda and penguins), and would not bore children and adults
there is also a huge crowd of people when we came on a weekend, though still bearable



i read that the zoo was the largest zoo in asia somewhere
the zoo really lived up to the billing
you could spend a whole day here
the panda attraction is the highlight here
extremely crowded on weekends
not nice to walk in rain so going in nice weather would be good


the taipei zoo is conveniently located right outside the taipei zoo metro station
the admission price was really cheap and the zoo was relatively huge
while the variety of animals isn't lacking, there was only a one or two of each animal
the most visited attraction is the panda house and that i felt that it was too crowded to get a good view
lastly, it would be great to visit the maokong mountain after the zoo as the zoo provides shuttle bus service (payable but cheap) to the cable car station



be prepared to walk
you will find the panda "room" right on start of the zoo trip
get ready for lines and set your camera to burst mode, since you can't stop and watch the panda you need to do it going with the line
kids are gonna love it!


relatively nice zoo, some of the animals showing obvious distress at their unsuitable cages
fake rattle snake is a joke



i visited the zoo on 11 nov 2014
we arrived quite late at about 3
30pm and we saw just a few animals
the place wasn't crowded at all, and it was nice just strolling along
just be mindful that it can get quite smelly at some spots
regretted that we didn't spend more time in it though
worth it for the price



inside taipei zoo, just for an entrance fee of nt$60, you can see a variety of animals, including koala, panda and penguin that are quite rare
the zoo is huge, recommend to take shuttle train to visit those animals



i liked the fact it only cost the equivalent of $2
50 aud to visit the zoo and see the pandas
only dislike is it can get crowded
my tip is to go either during the week or first thing when it opens



pandas! what a great enclosure to see pandas! really cheap zoo by most standards and you can pay with the easy card, so load that up to skip the line
get the ticket on the way in to see the pandas during your specified time and then wander a great big zoo with lots of attractions
we were a bit disappointed on the monday when the penguins / polar bear exhibit was closed, so there is a maintenance schedule to watch for
food / drink availablity are good and not overpriced like north american zoos
the train was also handy for quick transport to the far end of the zoo as well, so if you have a little one, it's a nice ride (but not scenic)


upon entering the zoo at 9
30am, we were given panda entry tickets for 10
30am timing
took the kids to the children's zoo then slowly walked twds the panda house
felt rather rushed at panda viewing enclosure
we had to quickly walk through it because the staff kept telling the visitors to move on move on
after panda house, we took the shuttle train to the top of the zoo for nt5
nothing to see along the way
i liked that they have a special spacious cabin just for strollers for us to push the stroller up the ramp to the cabin
no need to fold and keep away before boarding
we visited penguin house , africa animals, desert animals
skipped the rest due to lack of time & because we were tired
plus there was a lot of walking to get from 1 zone to another
my 3-yr old enjoyed it lots
the adults were all very tired from the almost 4hrs of walking


we rented a stroller for nt50 (+ deposit nt500/1000??) so my toddler need not walk much
there are many drinks dispenser selling the drinks at very reasonable prices, around nt10~20
water cooler available too
items sold at souvenir shops were reasonably priced
many areas to sit down and rest and picnic
however do note there aren't many shelters around
quite an enjoyable trip to the zoo for us



i enjoyed the surrounding as much as the animals
the zoo is situated in a nice botanical garden
i was a bit upset to see that the hippo did not have water to play
the zoo is clean and well kept
there are many places to buy food or simply rest on a bench
i have enjoyed my time there


admission price was cheap! the panda exhibits were nice
the shuttle service whilst cheap at nt$5 per person, only brings you to the bird enclosure and doesn't allow you to see any of the animals
spacious with lots of places for people to sit and kids to run around
exhibits i felt were so so compared to some of the more "world class" zoos but it was good enough for the kids



more like a kid's zoo
spacious and not overwhelming
the weather was cooling and the signs were in bad english
however, it was quite amusing
great for families but i don't think it is a must go


the zoo is enormous, so will take about half a day to walk around so wear comfortable shoes
very cheap entry, about 60nt
great day out for families or people who love animals! wide variety of animals, zoo is clean and there are good facilities inside



at only a couple us dollars, this zoo is the best deal in taipei
we've been too many zoos in the usa but saw a lot of animals new to us here
make sure you allocate at least a half day, if not more, because this is a very large zoo
all the exhibits were lovely and the place is well maintained
once you get done, head over next door to the gondolas
november weather was perfect for our outing
there is ample food, drinks, and rest room stops throughout



staff knows what are they doing, beautiful, attractive and amazing zoo
animal looks happy it means that excellent job in taking care of animals
may need more monitoring of public i saw one visitor feeding a coke to a monkey



great day out
our toddler loved seeing all the animals and so did we
remember to walk in the right side (follow the arrows) or people can get a little mad ;-)


lovely location with family friendly seating/tables for taking a break
tickets given at the time of arrival to visit the panda house with assigned slots to ensure that the most popular exhibit is available to everyone
good day of fun for adults and kids alike and very close to the gondola entry



if you don't know what to do, exeperience the zoo, is very nice
i went there with my sister'family and we enjoyed so much!


i wanted to see this by myself, to get my own opinion
unfortunately, previous comments (see below) were right: nearly all animals are alone, in their tinny cage and show obvious signs of depression (mainly stereotypical behaviours)
the black bear was walking in circles, the orang-utan had such a sad-looking face, the asian elephants were swinging their trumps endlessly (typical sign of profound depression in elephants)
this is because animals are either alone, or totally lacking of stimulation
not to mention the skinny tiger and the hippos, stuck in tinny bath tubs


i was gutted
i would recommend not to go there, or to take action for the enhancement of living conditions of these animals


which can be made possible as taipei is not a poor city



this is a great zoo on many levels
great displays of many different animals from all over
easy walking although the zoo is quite large
they have a tram if you don't want to walk
food and drinks very reasonably priced
admission is only a couple of dollars usd
a must see in taipei in my opinion



not my first trip to this zoo, and i always love it
as this was right after the birth of yuanzai, the line to get into the panda exhibit was unbelievable
my mother and i quickly decided to forgo it
the good news is that since everyone else was in line at the pandas, we had the rest of the zoo to ourselves pretty much
the zoo has a good variety of animals and can keep families occupied for an afternoon
2 warnings: 1
 the zoo is primarily out door (which is normal) and taipei is unbearable in the summer
try to plan a late fall or early spring trip if possible
2
 the only restaurant inside the zoo is mcd so if you don't like fast food, pack a lunch



this is an average zoo --- nothing particularly special other than the panda exhibit
i was a bit disappointed that many of the exhibits seem to be consistent with zoo standards of 50 years ago; small (primarily dirt) spaces for the animals
pros:cheap (very cheap)convenient to transitpandasgift shopsmalaysian crocodilesconsmost of the exhibits appear to be 50 years old, even though it is less than 30 years oldin general, worth a visit if you are interested in wildlife of taiwan or the giant pandas
ps: when you enter the zoo they give you a small ticket stub --- i was not sure what it was for (a raffle?); i found out when i went to the panda exhibit; at the panda exhibit they ask you for the ticket stub --- the stub has the time that you are allowed to enter the panda exhibit



nice place to walk around and cheap admission too! combine with gondola trip for a complete experience


not a fan of zoos, so take this review with a grain of salt
i think zoos are just prisons for animals
they make me sad
i went to this one and while for the most part, the animals see to be well treated


some of the larger animals (bears for example) didn't have a lot of space to roam, play and live
some animals (large cats) had big spaces, so i am not sure why they give larger spaces to some animals and "normal" spaces to others
still much better zoos than the two i went to in korea and china



i wanted to visit the museum just to see the panda

but i've ended up spend around 3 hours here
to start, the price is really cheap, only 60ntd (and there are even discount at 30 ntd for policemen and low income household)
there were literally animals from almost every corner of the world
there are camels, zebra, kangaroo, bear, and many more
i did not even had the time to visit the reptiles and birds park
this is the best zoo that i've been too up to date
it is worth to spend at least half a day here especially if you have kids
bring some food and water too
the park opens at 9 am
go early and avoid the weekend (i went on monday and there were not many people, most of theme were school student)



we spent almost the whole day at the zoo
entrance fee is less than nt100, good for family with young kids to explore around
we took maokong up and down stop at the zoo station



taipei zoo is not like other zoos in asia other than singapore zoo it is 1st class and very large the animals live in large enclosures lots of room no expense spared they have animals from everywhere i spent 5 hours their and didn't see everything take comfortable shoes and a hat it can get hot entree fee is cheap really cheap great day out recommended


the biggest attraction is the panda bears and my sole reason for my visit
getting to the zoo is great using the mrt metro and admission to the zoo is very reasonable
i did see a few other exhibits but it was very crowded
the time i visited the cub was not out but the two parents were
if you never saw pandas in the real then by all means go to the zoo
i would suggest trying on a tuesday when there are less crowds
enjoy!


if you are with kids, taipei zoo is the best place and easy to go with mrt transport stopping in the front step
it is cheap admision fee $3 and there is koala, panda, african animals, the place you can not miss



you will be amazed how much you will experience in taipei's city zoo, which we did in june 2014
 too many things to describe here
one particular attraction is the palace for panda
there will be long queue almost all the time
the thomas train is good to go as well as other adventures
another benefit is that the zoo is close to taipei metro and the maokong cable train
all hello kitty fans will not miss this in taipei
wonderful experiences for everybody



the zoo is a bit old and tired but they look after their animals
the funny part was going to see the pandas - well you were given a ticket when you paid your entry at the zoo gates which was about $1
50 australian
we were given a 10 min time interval to go to see the pandas- we arrived and entered the building - we joined the line and we were all walked past the glass enclosure where the pandas were but you had to keep moving - no hanging around - move along hahaha
there is a train - we recommend you take it up to the top and work your way down - you have to have the right money - no change is given - it was 5ntd each when we went



huge place
exhausting walk on a hot day
very cheap but place was a bit run down
toilets near mcdonalds were clean and airy



i went to the panda exhibit
they were very active, walking around, chewing on bamboo branches
the lines were not too long since i visited in the evening but inside is crowed, hard to take pictures



hop on the tram as it will take you around the zoo
or you can walk around and can look at the animals and take pictures
there is a steep hill to walk going back
perhaps you can catch a ride with the next tram
they have a night safari, which i feel is the same as the day
a taxi standbut no taxis during the day, at night ???


we intended to go on the gondola but found out that it was closed
we decided to go to the zoo since it was at the same mrt stop
great decision
i'm a big panda fan so it was great
cost of the entrance fee included getting in to the panda house - very inexpensive and worth it
no real crowds maybe because it was a monday so visiting was enjoyable - very hot though



the zoo is very accessible and you can just take the metro
although the zoo is quite big it was quite easy to get around with getting lost! however try to wear comfortable walking shoes when you go and it may be hard to enjoy yourself on a really hot day!!! overall, i think the zoo is a great attraction and it has a vast variety of species ( great fun!)


i happy to visit zoo in taipei
you may go by metro
the entrance fees is super cheap, only taiwan money 60
00



easily accessible use metro system
many varieties and lively animals to see, so are uncommon and rare
such as different kinds of paradise birds and flamingo
more animals then i've seemed in other zoo



a nice family visit
easy to get there
visited the zoo
hop on the tram to save some time
panda viewing was a bit of hurrying and luck
luvs d koalas & penguins
plenty of walking due to the size
easy to move to next venue i
e
maokong gondola



i will visit taipei zoo with my family whenever i am in taiwan
we love to spend a day in this beautiful zoo as the place is huge and very clean
the zoo is easily accessible by mrt or taxi from the city
stroll along the park is such a wonderful things to do with my young toddler
we'll love the panda sanctuary as well as the african park
the price of the ticket is very reasonable and affordable
is definitely worth the time to visit this place
taipei zoo is simply amazing place



the zoo is surprisingly huge and there is alot of stuff to see! the entrance fee is very cheap (nt$60 per pax)
the zoo is very well maintained and interesting
a good attraction in taipei
we visited the maokong gondola first then took the cable down to taipei zoo
you can just spend a day at the area because it can be quite tiring after touring around the zoo



very inexpensive(less than $3 usd) and very accessible by the mrt
the grounds are beautifully well kept and gives you the sense of being in the jungle
we really really really enjoyed the panda exhibit and the formosan animals
there was a great variety of animals from all over the continent, including good old north america! the pens and cages seemed to be comfortable for the animals and we didn't get the sense that there was any neglect or abuse
a good day excursion, overall- just be prepared to do a lot of walking!(we chose not to take the train, as we wanted to experience the whole park)


i enjoyed the much of this like the penguins and polar bear swimming (not together lol)
but this place was very busy did not get to see the panda bears or the koalas
also difficult at times to follow the map


we secured our panda tickets but then there is such a huge crowd and they really push and shove you along so you cant get a proper photo
thought were meeting madonnacor the president or something lol
it was a laughable experience in the end kind of a let-down
the rest of the zoo was better
though a lot of it was under construction
good to see, because it needs to grow



nice environment and good attractions
panda display is good and tropical environment very nice to see



taipei zoo is quite vast in terms of land area
you can access this also from the cable car, alighting at taipei zoo south station
from there you can walk all the way down, passing trough different animal displays up to the main gate
i recommend visiting a little bit early as any less than three hours of visit is not enough to see all the animals



likesvariety of animalsentrance is relatively cheap 60twdease to get there (via mtr) took more than 3 hours if you're like me and take photos of everything got to see pandas! dislikescould be hot in summer as there is limited shade like most zoossome of the pens were under renovation


best panda bear exhibit i have ever seen
the entire zoo is well planned and very pleasant to walk through
it is located on a hillside, so walking is not for those who are older or infirm
there is a ride that will carry you to the top of the hill and then you can meander down to the entrance
great penguin display as well
the grounds and gardens are worth seeing, even if there were no animals
go see it !


why did i give this zoo a rating of terrible? have you seen the condition of the tigers in the zoo!?! they are very,very skinny it is a crime! how can a zoo let this happen to owns animals? is everyone in taipei blind to the fact that this animal is very underweight
the pandas are treated like royalty, the tigers look they are barely fed
i am pretty sure that a tiger should way close to 700 lbs, the tiger that i saw at this zoo looked closer to maybe 300 lbs on a day they got a meal
probably 200lbs
after seeing this, my wonderful day at the zoo seemed a bit dark
i purchased some items from the zoo hopefully the money goes to feeding the tigers and not promoting the pandas that you only get to see behind shiny clear plastic for only 10 minutes
raise the ticket prices if you must, but feed the tigers, dammit! disgustingly cruel!


very nice exhibits, especially the pandas but the pavilions are very spread out
if you attend in the summer you will not make it from one exhibit to the next without be soaked
at least its affordable with an entry fee of about one american dollar



it's very nice place for hang out with friends and family but in rainy times it is not convenient at all and lot of construction going on at the zoo, better try on sunny day and must watch the african elephants and gorillas!


very nice zoo to visit; well maintained
the visit takes about 2
5-3 hours so try to arrive before 2,00pm if you want to fully enjoy it as the zoo closes at 5,00pm
the pandas are are a must to see



the zoo is really modern and there is lots of variety of animals! there's plenty to keep adults and kids occupied and the space was well thought out
in the future though, i would suggest to other travellers, go in, grab the tickets to see the pandas, and then go to the panda area
after that, go back to the entrance and take the shuttle train to the top and make your way down from there
most of the zoo is uphill and it's easier going downhill!pity, large parts of it was other construction when i was visiting
when it's done, it promises to be an even better exhibition!


this place is a good spot for nice day out (if it's not raining only)on the brown line mrt it is the last station which is either connected to maokong gondola also
in the zoo there are so many restaurants also to buy cheap food and don't forget to have a look at the african elephants and white tiger!


the zoo is very modern in that the animals are in natural surroundings rather than behind cages
it reminded me a lot of the dc and san diego zoos
it is quite large but easily walk-able and nicely signed throughout
the big attraction are the panda bears
they were actually moving around when we saw them (they are usually notoriously slothful)
the subway goes right to the zoo
very much enjoyed the day here!


good collection of the animals
as recommended by many people, you can take the cable car to the upper end of the zoo and walk your way down
but walking up hills isn't too bad when you bring a stroller for the young kids



we were there august 2014
 the whole place smelled of poop
it was so overwhelming



totally disgusting
the enclosures were overgrown with weeds
not very well kept at all
the panda enclosure was ok but over crowded with people


everyone shoving and pushing
overall the stink was over bearing !!


the taipei zoo is easily as assessable via their metro line and offers amazingly cheap admission fee (30nt weekend summer promotion; 60nt for regular admission) for the selections of animals you can see
the zoo is quite big but there is a tram that takes people to the other end of the zoo for an additional fee of 5nt
i spent almost 2-3 hours at the zoo and the highlight of it must be the panda house where they have both the mother and her child
my friend and i went during the summer, where it was really hot, and we had to buy a few water bottles from the souvenir store
it's also a good idea to bring a hat or anything to provide shade since it's mainly outdoors



this zoo is my must-go place in taipei
i have been there for thtee times and am still loving it
very educational
it has a wide variety of animals, from insects to birds, from african animals to australian and even arctic animals
they are still expanding the zoo for more! they have introductions for each species, where some of them are very extensive
people like me who don't see animal often in cities would love this place
the entrance fee is cheap, just 60 taiwanese dollars
some advice:1
if you are not very good at fitness or walking, i suggest you take the little train in the zoo to the top of the zoo and walk back to the entrance to visit diffetent zoo areas along way
because going from entrance to the end of the zoo is up-hill
the train costs 5 taiwanese dollors per head
prepare exact change though
2
 the zoo is mainly outdoor
prepare bug repellant and sunscreen
bring a water bottle, there are water fountains for refilling water
3
 it closes farely early, at 17:00
plan ahead
4
 easy card (the card for taipei metro) is accepted for entrance fee
for those who don't like waiting in lines



it is a great experience
this zoo trip can be done together with maokong gondola
do visit the zoo early, and head up to maokong mountain for sunset before heading down
the zoo is very huge with a large collection of animals
the entrance fee is very affordable at nt30 during weekdays
slightly more during weekends
the major highlight of the zoo, is the panda enclosure
it is very huge zoo, therefore, do allocate about 3 - 4 hours for a comfortable visit
:)


the zoo is spacious probably due to its location at the outskirt of taipei city
no worry of the transportation as you can take metro taipei to the taipei zoo station
walking distance from the exit to the entrance of the zoo
you can rent stroller if your toddler is tired of walking uphill
there is a mcdonald fastfood near the entrance
i visited the zoo during weekday but it was crowded just as weekend
many local people came to have their leisure time in there
we need to take number and queue for our turn to visit the panda inddor and outdoor
long queue but the zoo keepers managed the crowd in order
my family arrived the zoo in the late noon so we only managed to witness panda and koala bear
pandas are kept in a larger scale enclosure than hong kong ocean park but the koala bear's enclosure looks abit lonely
keep in mind that there is an inclining uphill route from panda park to desert zone
anyhow, you can opt to take train inside the zoo



they have everything in this zoo - lions, tigers, (even a few polar bears, i believe - but i might be wrong)
there are the pandas as well, along with more pedestrian zoo fixtures such as elephants, hippos, giraffes, etc
the animals are grouped in large areas that correspond roughly to the animals' habitats and climate: jungle, rainforest, africa, polar regions


you get the picture
but the biggest attraction has to be the price
kids are free and adults get in for a little over $2
here's a tip: the zoo covers the side of slightly-sloping hill, so the best strategy is to walk up to the top, and then take each section walking downhill
also, if you ride the tram/gondola ride up to the top of the hill, problem solved!


i love the misted walkways that cooled us off in the summer heat
the soft water droplets evaporated, leaving us refreshed and serene!


this zoo is 100 years old
they did a very good job there, it's right off the mrt (metro) station, and is very accessible
a lot to see
they have a huge variety of animals there, and the animals don't seem to suffer
they have some big nice tropical jungles there


+ve- very affordable entrance fees compared to some of the more established in asia- easily assessible, near the taipei metro- next to mao kong, which is another place to visit if your zoo trip ends early-ve- some of the animal exhibits are under renovation- frequency of tram ride not as fast


we went on the hottest day of the year which was hard for both us and the animals :( but it was still a good visit
the zoo is big, so lots of space and a great variety of animals
lots of information about so can be educational
some staff spoke some english so you can get about
a mcdonalds inside too which was good because we were hungry! souvenirs were a good keepsake
reasonably priced
worth the visit



for less than a dollar you can escape the hubbub of the city and go hang out with the animals
there are so many hippos!


went to taipei zoo on a saturday morning and it wasn't too crowded
we had limited time so we bee-lined for what we want to see the most, the pandas
was lucky to see one of them on a closer range (one walked near the glass wall) while another was munching on some plants and shrubs
they were so cute! we then came to see the koala, but it was kinda disappointing as they were just perched on the tree and not moving at all
some of the other animals too seemed too lazy or tired

must be the weather
it was a huge zoo, sections were not near each other, and given the extreme summer heat, it was kinda uncomfortable walking up the hill



i already don't like zoos and this is one of the bad ones, better that mayanmar's that's about it
poor animals, not at the level of san-diego's that is very clear
should modernize

anyhow, i feel like no one should support zoos, national parks and wild territories are better for animals, don't you think?


it really depends on how you feel
personally, i feel that the taipei zoo was fun as i had an enjoyable day with my girlfriend here
even though it was raining when we came but we managed to see some animals that sg do not have
took quite a no of photos too
cheap entrance ticket too



this zoo is set on the mountain side so expect some sweat during the summer months
however the animal enclosures are all very well designed to blend in with the nature
the whole experience is very nice and well worth a visit



the taipei zoo is clean, well kept, and the animals seem to be well taken care of
the admission fee is far below what you would expect for such a zoo
food selection at the zoo is pretty poor
either bring your own or wait to eat until you finish your zoo journey



cheap to enter and easy to get to (via the metro) however the 'adventure' ends there
i was disappointed with the exhibits and a lot of animals appeared to be missing or looking half dead
mind you, it is currently summer and the humidity is draining
the animals were defiantly feeling this
the panda looked stressed and kept staring at a cement wall looking for an escape
poor thing!naturally the children are oblivious to all the stress the animals endure
they run a muck whilst i found a lot of them banging on the glass exhibits
save your money and don't support this place



great place to visit with lots of animals to see, not to mention one of the few zoos that host panda bears! the admission fee is unbelievably cheap compared to zoos in the us, free to senior citizens and kids 12 and under, regular admission 2 us dollars!! and just like anywhere in taiwan, the zoo is loaded with food stands/ restaurants
one of the must visit place in taipei!!


this zoo is larger than what i expect
i would rate it as one of the best
the animals are kept in places which are quite spacious
you can find zoo keepers seriously doing their jobs in there
you can even find animals from africa and madagascar
although i saw polar animals in the map i did not go there because it was too hot to venture so far up to the hills
for those who find it too hot and tiring to walk, there is a bus carriage within the zoo going up the hill for 5nt per person
visited the panda sanctuary
the sanctuary may not be the best
they do not have real grass ground for the pandas but just concrete floors
there is the baby yuen yuen that they are most proud of staying in there
there is a small playground in there for the bear
i understand it is most costly to build a more life like natural habitat for the pandas but i hope one day they will have enough budget to do so
overall, the children love the zoo
this place is too hot during the summer probably reaching up to 36c



i find this a normal zoo
nothing much to see and the panda has it's own show time so you really have to make sure you come in on time to see the panda
i also noticed other animals to be very inactive, probably since they are enclosed and within a limited space, unlike singapore zoo



checking out panda's is just a cool thing to do
i mean, how many times can you get to do that??the zoo itself is nice as well with allot to see
it can get hot in the summer, so be prepared
but again- just the panda view is enough to make the trip and to even deal with the heat



no wonder, this zoo is one of the best zoo in asia
clean, tidy, convenient for tourist in a group, family or even solo tourist
very well maintain zoo, and affordable entrance ticket
very recommended



we had a 17 hour layover in taiwan so thought we would go to the zoo
managed to find our way from the airport to the main station and out to the zoo - not too hard to work out
it was 35 degrees but intensely humid so we ended up buying umbrellas from the myriad of street sellers outside the zoo
the zoo is ridiculously cheap at around $2
50nz for two adults and two kids
they also have stroller hire which was fantastic for us
we didn't see the whole zoo because it was just too hot but we did see the pandas and african animals enclosure
the queue for the pandas was very long and took some time, and once you get there they move you on fairly quickly
the zoo train isn't like most tour trains we have been on, in that it is really only to take you from point a to point b - there is nothing to see on the way - we were hoping you might be able to see some animals
extensive gift shops with very reasonable pricing
our only slightly negative comment would be the relatively small size of some of the animal enclosures compared to nz
the 5 hippos occupied a space the same size as auckland zoo's 2 hippos
there was a lot more to see i am sure but with two tired kids and equally tired parents (little sleep on a 13 hour flight) we called it quits and headed back to the air-conditioned trains and malls of taipei


cheap and so so reasonable entrance fee
you get to check out many different animals according to their region in the world
but main attractions will be the 3 pandas, africa region, gorilla and amphibian and reptile centre
visit during a cool day
only visit the regions you're interested in
it's really huge so legs gonna pay the price
take the maokong gondola to maokong and have tea will watching sunset after a long tired day

for summer, take the gondola btwn 430-5pm and sun sets at 630


enjoyed a half day tour at the zoo
we came during the weekday and boy was i shocked by the entrance fee
$30 per person! pricier on the weekends and public holidays at a fee of $60 but hey, still very cheap
they feature many animals and of course the main attraction are the pandas
however, the rest of the animals being displayed disappointed me
but at a price of ntd30, i have nothing much to complain
would recommend to come for a tour of the whole zoo if you have extra time
if short on time, just coming for the pandas is worth it



taipei zoo seems to be around for some time, but with its location nearby the maokong gondola station, you can spend some time exploring the zoo
when we were there, it seems like the zoo is undergoing some construction, so hopefully it will be finish the next time we will be there



the only things that they promo is the only panda, nothing else
i relaly dissapoint went there and found nothing interesting
the enterance fee is cheap but return dissappointment



very hot for work aournd to see animal, pls prepary hot and humid weather between july till september



this saw really good time
i went out with some of my taiwanese friends and we had a blast
there is so much that the zoo has to offer, that its best to sum it all up and say "amazing"
take your time do see the entire zoo, all of its attractions
leaving the best for last, take a breath taking and truly scenic ride on the sky car
a lovely view of taipei and taipei 101 awaits you



i've been to other zoos in other cities, and this one is average at best
the animal selection is a been-there-done-that feeling with the standard lions, elephants, camels, giraffes, monkeys
the panda exhibit was extra
admission was very inexpensive and the facilities are clean
there is a mcdonalds if you get hungry



not recommendable at all! there are more things to do, and this zoo is not exciting like others, for example the zoo in copenhagen, denmark



the zoo tickets are inexpensive
the little train takes you around to different areas of the zoo and is frequent
the exhibits are okay and good enough for the animals
i liked the orangutan the best
he was drinking water from a running faucet and playing in the water, and when the keeper turned off the source, he was trying to turn it back on
it was cute
taipei is very hot and humid in the summer time, so drink plenty of water
you can take a bus all the way back to taipei main station



ticket is cheap and many thing to see
but avoid go there in summer time then it will be very hot
food is not really good inside, try visit there at 9am and finish before 1ish then go other area to have food



unfortunately very hot and humid day so did not spend too much time at the zoo, but wanted to see the pandas, so cute and there were no line ups to get inside!!! disliked the fact that some of the animals do not have enough space to roam



for some reason, i always compare animal attractions back to the san diego zoo and sea world
the taipei zoo was designed by the same people that designed the san diego zoo and it is a great family excursion
the animals seem to have enough space to roam around and the displays all seem respectful of the animals so you don't have to feel sorry for them
of course, giant pandas are the main attraction, but all sorts of great distractions and easy to spend a day here



this zoo seems to focus on the cuter animals
i really enjoyed the pandas and red panda which just arrived


the zoo is very clean and neat
the entrance fee is cheap, even though it's crowded on the weekend
good place to spend your time with family and friends



i didn't plan for this trip to taipei zoo but my travel companion insisted on paying it a visit after knowing there were three pandas on display! a few things caught me by surprise:1) it was huge and way bigger than singapore zoo2) there were animals we don't get to see back in singapore like koalas, the great ape etc
3) ticket pricing was so much more economical4) drinks at vending machines can cost as low as s$0
50
having said that, maintenance was a bit lacking (hallo, one adult ticket was like s$3) and information in english were inconsistent which can be frustrating for those who don't really have a good grasp of the chinese written language

i went with three friends and we loved the variety of animals and shops
train ride is nt5 (exact change or easycard) and if you're studying in taiwan you get in for nt30
present your isic card at the ticket booth, or if your card is also your easycard just use that at the entrance and it will deduct the reduced fair
don't forget to bring a water bottle
there are water stations all across the zoo but keep in mind the water may be warm after a lot of people use it
last note: keep the little white ticket they give you at the entrance
that's you're ticket to get in at the panda exhibit
it shows the time you can go but if you miss it just line up and go to a different time slot
enjoy!


the zoo features the first taiwanese panda, yuan zai
she is on display with the other giant panda's in the xinguang special exhibit house
there is a time stamped entry ticket provided when you enter the zoo
the line is long, but is facilitated and moves along briskly
the pandas are behind glass
also of interest is the native formosan animal area



finally got a chance to see kola bear as i haven't go to australia before
the month that i went to the zoo is way to hot
therefore we were perspiring non-stop
the entrance to the zoo is so cheap and we went twice as we didn't realize every start of the month of monday, panda is not available
overall is an experience to visit



this was the 3rd visit to taipei zoo
and finally able to cover the whole zoo
i can say is far more greater than the zoo of my own country
me and my wife are animal lovers, we reach there around 11am and we spend our time here till 5
30pm
is great to see that they have upcoming big upgrade project, giving me the reason to visit again
in our 1st visit, we only cover a small area, i love the nocturnal animal exhibit, but somehow, on my 2nd visit, thy close down for renovation, and change to learning center and library
i cant wait to see the upgraded birds section and upcoming new hippo exhibit
and, the price is 8x cheaper but far more greater and far lot more exhibit than the zoo of my own country
a great place for family visit



i'm not a big fan of zoos to begin with but i solely came to see my two beloved pandas, tuan tuan and yuan yuan, as i spent one summer in bifengxia panda base taking care of them for a month
as such, i cannot provide an evaluation of how the zoo is overall because it was raining cats and dogs that day and i literally went to see the pandas and headed out
zoos in many parts of the world, (including shamefully, canada) are notorious for providing a lack of enrichment for their animals and taipei's enclosure for tuan tuan, yuan yuan, and their 1 year old baby yuan zai, was no exception to this sad reality
it really bothered me that yuan yuan was pacing and panting the whole time i observed her
i was told by a friend that the stress may have been attributable to the celebrations of yuan zai's 1st birthday the day before
however, i did talk to a couple of other locals throughout the next couple of days, and they all said that they felt that yuan yuan appears to be a stressball all the time - and we all went different days
pacing and panting are both signs of an incredible amount of stress
i really do hope they try to make her enclosure a little better
she used to have tons of visitors at bifengxia and i've never seen her in this state before
needless to say, it really broke my heart and i really hope that they improve this situation asap
fee for the zoo is very cheap - ~ 2-3 usd per adult



the singapore zoo is about 100 times better than this place
i think the main attraction is the pandas where they herd people through with a guy on a bullhorn yelling at everyone to keep moving
very uninteresting



all the std zoo expectations but the crowds are terrible! a nice extra is the gondola that leaves from the zoo



zoo can be reached by mrt and has variety of animals


i was a bit dissapointed to see it as i have seen lot better zoo's across the world

zoo has good collections of reptiles and frogs





was there during extreme hot weather
there are resting area and bath rooms every 30-50 metres
a good collection of different animals
layout is quite well thought through



it was fun to see the mother panda and her six month old who is now about the same size as momma bear
although i have travelled to africa i never got to see the white rhinos so seeing three of them was a treat



conveniently accessible by metro
you can see pandas if they are not sleeping
they do not move much! :) also koalas
fun for kids and for adults as well
you can learn some about the local animals and see some of them



the enterance fee is really cheap compare to singapore 

it have many aninmals to see and quite big area to walk around the zoo
you get to see panda too which include in the 60ntd enterance fee, and they organise quite well, they will give you a time slot to visit the panda home 




easily reached by the taipei rapid transit system the taipei zoo is well worth a visit, particularly if the kids are along
well appointed and with modern animal displays
of course the giant pandas are the headliners





the animals look better looked after than other zoos
my kids aged 4 and 5 really enjoyed it, but it is a hot up hill walk unless start by taking a train to the top and come down instead



we visits the zoo because it's next to maokong gondola
there are panda and penguin, which my 5 year old son thought as special to offer
cheap entrance fee of twd60
there are mcdonald's and other food kiosks to buy food and drinks
but there are also lots of small mosquitoes to bite you
do bring repellent, please!


if you ever going to taipei, must visit the taipei zoo
firstly , the entrance fee is cheap
secondly, i get to see some animals which i can't get to see in singapore
thirdly, i get to see baby panda with its parents





yeah





is just a place to walk around and see animals




lol
enjoy







good value for moneymy kids really enjoyed the place, a lot of animals to see
entry fee only nt 60 for adults, children before enter primary school (abt 6 or 7 years old) are free
we only spent 3 hrs in the zoo, but there still a lot of animal that we have not see
so, i suggest come earlier if want to see all the animals



most of all we were impressed with the cheap entry fees for this zoo (especially compared to us zoo entrance fees like san diego)
we took the train here, and found it fairly easy to navigate
we came to see the baby panda, yuan zai
we did get a look at him, but the panda viewing area was a little rushed
we didn't have the opportunity to grab as many photos as we would have liked to
still well worth it given the cost
we thought the zoo was well maintained, and saw many animals
take the gondola if you have time, great ride with beautiful views, and my kids rode for free!


make sure to hop on the sky cart towards the top of the mountain
wonderful food carts parked along the narrow streets
the zoo was just enough for our 9 and 10 year old daughters
we visited in march and it could get quite warm so dress appropriately



i often take in a zoo in whichever city i happen to be in at the time
the zoo here is easily navigated to via the mtr which drops you off right outside
entry fee is minimal us $2 and there is mcdonalds & and local store just inside the gate entrance
i thought the zoo was pretty well laid out; it was a fabulous day on the day we went, hence there were many visitors but not so it was crowded, and young and old seemed to be having a grand time
the panda enclosure was awesome, but so were many of the other exhibits
importantly the animals seemed to be in relatively good condition, and the enclosures and the zoo for that matter was very clean
the administration seem to have the animals at heart with enclosures which are spacious compared to a lot of other zoos i have seen in asia which was pleasing to see
well worth visiting particularly if you have kids, they'll love it and mum and dad might become just as engrossed as we did witnessing all the animals



i like to visit zoo whenever i travel for holiday
however, this zoo is so so
if not for the pandas, else this zoo has nothing special to offer
tips: visit this zoo if you go maokong
cheap entrance ticket of twd60
can use easycard to pay
lots of mosquitoes
bring repellent please



there are several animal exhibits but we visited only the pandas (to visit the baby panda), the sun bear, the pangolin, the camel as well as the education centre and the insectarium
we went in the morning, reaching the zoo at 10am and it was a very sunny day
there were announcements reminding visitors to make use of the water coolers available as well as to rest in the shaded resting areas in the zoo, which we thought was a nice touch :) as many others here have commented, the admission fee is very value-for-money and one could spend a good 3-4 hours there
if you have forgotten to bring a hat or cap, many vendors are selling them outside the zoo
the souvenirs are also reasonably priced though most of the souvenirs sold in the zoo shop could be purchased in toy stores elsewhere, e
g
shopping malls, science education centre and jiufen old street, at the exact same price
you need not worry about meals if you aren't fussy with food
the 7-eleven outlet sells quite a variety of meals (taiwanese bento sets, japanese sushi sets, instant noodles, japanese oden (fish cakes etc on sticks in stock), sandwiches, salads, etc
there is also a mcdonald's outlet which offers you the familiar fare offered in any mc's outlets
having been to quite a few zoos around, i wouldn't say i'm particularly impressed by the taipei zoo
however, considering the entrance fee, you can consider this attraction if you have young kids nod you have half a day to while away



one of the better zoo we have visited
the animals looked well looked after
the entry fee was minimal
the zoo was nicely laid out
there is a convenient store if you don't feel like mcdonald's
overall i would recommend visiting if you have the time and definitely recommend for the children



old-style zoo, hardly worth a visit
7-eleven and mcdonalds inside
lots of construction
walked for 20 minutes before ever seeing an animal, then could barely see the sad looking beast due to poor visibility through the tall grass
walked a while longer and across some cool hippo sculptures
finally the hippos
too many for the small body of water they were in
made a quick run to see the lions, giraffes, and rhinos, before heading to the panda house
too many people there
saw just one panda, sleeping soundly
the main attractions seemed to be the retail shop and restaurant
the only good thing to say is the entrance fee is only 60ntd
i wouldn't suggest not going, just that it may not be worthwhile



very well planned zoo
panda enclosure was exceptional
cost was minimal and free for over-65's
although it rained the day we visited it was still worth the trip out to it on the mrt



if you have free time,you can bring your family to go to taipei zoo
sometimes you can see lots of special animals there and you can buy some souvenir when you go home



we went there without much planning and it was drizzling a bit, but that's taipei for most time of the year
the entry tickets were around us$ 2 per adult and lesser for kids and that it unbelievable for the size of this place and the attractions within it
we saw panda bear, koala bear, butterfly garden, flamingoes, deer and a lot more
the butterfly garden deserves a special mention and worth the visit
the souvenir shop was very good as well
kids simply enjoyed the evening
this place closes at 5 pm and would suggest 2pm to 5pm for this place



it is one of the biggest zoos in asia and it is worth it
it is cheap and you can easily spend the whole day there
the zoo is divided in several areas and you'll be able to see all types of animals
really nice!


went on a tuesday morning before our flight back home, thus did not have the time to walk the entire zoo
we were there to see the baby panda, yuan zai, and we were not disappointed
tickets were issued to the panda enclosure for a 10 minute window and there were other visitors mainly students and senior citizens
while there was a crowd, it was very orderly and we did not encounter problemi would say that the garden is well maintained with lots of vegetation
we were also surprised to find that there was also a koala bear enclosure as well (which is near the entrance)
entrance fee is relatively cheap compared to the singapore zoo, and you could pay the fee using easycard
note 1: do check the zoo website for dates where the various enclosures are closed for maintenance to avoid disappointment
typically it would close once a month
note 2: map is issued at the visitor centre, and typically one copy to every two visitors
the reason i understood was to reduce waste
thumb-up!


very nice zoo, lots of picture taking opportunities
everyone very helpful and courteous, zoo well organized, worth the trip and not expensive



with an entry coat of under one british pound and very easy access to from anywhere in the city this zoo is fantastic
it had a vide variety of well maintained exhibits and explanations in several languages including english, the staff where also very helpful, it is also next to the cable are up to the tea plantations on the mountains which is spectacular



the zoo is quite large, well organized, and have the unique pandas although it might be disappointing as the lines might be long and do not allow you to view the pandas much
other then that large selection of animals and could pass 2~3 hours easily and the admission is very cheap around 2$ per person


i was pretty impressed by the number of animals i saw in the taipei zoo
the zoo is divided into different species of animals and it's really really big
the animal habitats were also well kept and looked homey for the animals
the entrance fee is also really cheap
if you have a lot of stuff, there are lockers provided and also strollers for kids
there's also convenience stores, vendo machines, and toilets around the zoo for added convenience
you should really go here if you have kids
they'll surely love it!


had an opportunity to enjoy the zoo as part of our four day visit to taipei
although the weather was muggy, the exhibits, animals and related amenities were all worth visiting
easily accessible by the mrt and admission costs were very reasonable



i was amazed how good this zoo was for $2-3!! i'm a member of san diego zoo (one of the biggest zoo), and they charge $46 for single entry
of course they have more animals, but taipei zoo was not bad at all, actually very nice in peaceful setting
there was no line to see pandas when we went and we saw more pandas on one trip to taipei zoo than our many trips to san diego zoo
it was raining, so we almost canceled but actually it was the best time to go it seems like
they had plenty of animals to see and we'll go back again



the zoo is quite large, well organized, and there are many interesting animals such a bears, pandas and penguins
the information provided is informative without going over board
overall a nice place for a few hours, a day or multiple visits for anyone interested in animals
entree costs were 60ntd (adult) / 30ntd(child)


really liked the zoo
the panda exhibit was a bit of letdown, but the zoo is big with a large variety of animals
and they have a unique insect section that i highly recommend
and it's extremely convenient at the end of the metro line and very affordable nt$60 = us$2 for entrance



go later in the day mid week to avoid the line to see the baby panda
take the gondola to the tea plantation as it takes off from the same mrt stop


i came here for the pandas (which were awesome), but the other exhibits are quite nice too
the zoo is quite big and the entire thing is quite scenic (lots of plantlife and whatnot)
despite coming for the pandas, the butterfly house ended up being my favorite
lots of butterflies roaming freely and lots of pretty plants everywhere



the big attraction at the taipei zoo is the panda exhibit
you'll get an up close view of the three pandas, and lots of informative videos in the building
entrance fares into the zoo are very reasonable
probably one of the lowest cost zoos i've ever been to!


as a tourist, i seldom consider zoo as one of the destination
but, taipei zoo is exceptional
well-maintained and organized
the entrance fee is only 40ntd
my son was really excited as he saw panda bear, koala bear, penguin, and etc


the walk-way was comfortable
and there was shuttle with a nice locomotive design to take us from one station to the other end of the zoo
after visiting the zoo, we took the shuttle to the maokong gondola station to tried the cable car
excellent place



the zoo is large and very well kept
staff is very helpful and polite
lots of beautiful vegetation everywhere
the pandas are a great attraction so be prepared to stand in line
the aviary has been under repair for almost a year, don't know if/when it will be operating again but it's more or less my favorite spot in taipei
interesting exhibitions for amphibians and penguins
one mcdonald just outside the entrance and another just inside
one convenience store inside
you will have to stand in line for 10-20 minutes at each of these during weekends
it's imperative to use taxi or the subway to get there during holidays and weekends as the parking fills up completely: however due to size and good organization, it never gets unpleasantly crowded inside



like :* reachable via subway (terminal station)* see pandas, penguins and many, many other animals* spend a full day - so many animals* entrance fee is less than us$4/- per persondislike :* some construction going on to expand and upgrade the premises


with only us$2
00, you will see pandas, koala bears, black bears 


it is clean, well maintained and well organized
you will be given a specific time to see the pandas so you don't have to wait in line for hours



we went originally for the gondola and upon leaving the mrt station learned it was closed for maintenance, so we visited the zoo instead
very affordable entry fee and nice way to spend half a day
a bit crowded with the school visits, but otherwise nice
zoos aren't really my thing, but my kids liked it!


we took the gondola ride up to the maokong station from the taipei zoo area
taipei zoo entrance fee is 60nt
senior citizen are entitled to a cheaper ticket
the most exciting for us is to be able to see the little panda
we went there in the early morning and there was not much crowd/que to see the panda
oh yes, you need to que to see the panda


the zoo is open from 9am to 5pm
i think it is worth it
we've spend about 2 hours there
hhhhmmm, can't wait to see the panda at malaysia kl zoo soon






a great zoo
seeing the panda and koala bears, in itself, was worth the admission of 60 nt ($2 us), let alone the remaining animals
also worthwhile is the maokong gondola which is just next door
for only 50 nt, you can ride to the top of the mountain for some nice views
the admission for both of these attractions is conveniently payable by easy card



fun place to go


avoid it like the plague on a scorching summer day
we went in the middle of summer on what started out as a beautiful day and turned into a scorcher



this is an excellent zoo
unbeatable value, easily accessible and a large variety of animals to see
lots of walking but think that goes for any large zoo
i just loved the pandas
they are so gorgeous and so entertaining with their clumsiness! went on a weekday and there wasn't a crowd
be sure to check the time on the ticket given to you on park admission, this is the time allocated to you for entry into the panda hall


it is only a 10minute time slot!!! they had queuing barriers set up so it must get a massive crowd on the weekends
almost all the animal habitats have very pleasant landscaping with greenery, rocks, pools, mud environments etc
its an enjoyable day out



the zoo offers good value for a ticket price of only twd60, about the price you pay for a serving of fried chicken at night markets
you get to see the panda family at no extra charge
do go on weekdays to avoid the crowd and check their websites for the dates where the panda exhibition is closed



this is my first trip to taiwan
this zoo is quite impressive because you to see the pandas and it is so cheap in comparison to singapore
it is accessible by bus or mrt train, which is also an advantage if you were to compare with other countries
it's a pity that the maokong gondola is under maintenance and so, i did not get to take a ride



be prepared to walk, walk, walk


but it is sooo beautiful! the pandas and penguins are the stars
there is good food all around
best of all, it is great value for money, you wont break the bank
it is a pleasant mrt ride on the brown line



admission to the zoo is very affordable at a price of nt$60
i also rented a locker to put my bulk belongings for about nt$20 by the entrance
in the zoo, the animals look like they are well taken care of and provided lots of open space (unlike the time i was at the singapore zoo which featured polar bears with limited space and little cooling options)
the taipei zoo has lots of open space, and features anything from zebras and giraffes to an amphibian and penguin exhibit
from the top of the zoo, i took the shuttle train back down for nt $5
note, when you first enter, the staff will provide you a ticket
since it was in chinese, i was very confused
the white receipt-looking ticket will indicate a 9 minute time frame near your entrance time into the zoo for which you can check out the panda exhibition
if you e miss the time indicated or loose your 'ticket,' you will not be able tonter
my main goal was to check out the gondola while i was nearby, however, it is currently under maintenance between may 5 to may 19 2014
 i would recommend visiting after may 19th, so you can check out both at once



this is a place worth visiting, i loved the panda and baby panda as well as the koala bears


they also have animals from africa, asia, australia and cold places


plan to spend a few hours there



:) living in taipei for my whole life,taipei zoo has always been my favorite place to go!! a perfect one day trip with your honey lover or friends
it's always crowded on weekend
that's just normal because this compact zoo is just so popular for those city people



i spent a day here as a adult in my mid to late 20s and was completely fascinated
the formosan animal exhibit was interesting and informative as the went to great detail about their work in conservation
also all usual zoo big hitters were there
the numerous bear exhibits and there collections of big and slightly smaller cats were great
the penguin and panda exhibits were great too



the zoo situated on the side a hill but don't let that put you off
if you start your tour by taking a free tram tide to the top of the zoo and work your way down this in our experience was easy on the body and we were able to see more of this lovely well kept zoo



due to the remarkably cheap entrance fee of just 60 twd this place is absolutely packed on weekends
i decided to have a quick look since i was in the vicinity to try out the maokong gondola, but it was very crowded
in order to see the main exhibit of the pandas you are given a time slot allocation upon entry: trouble is that is some 3 hours or so from when you actually enter! (presumably much better during the week) still it would make a good day out for families



just a minute walk from train station, the entrance fee was only nt60! i couldn't believe it, tidy, clean, lot of animals
i went there with 2 of my kids (5 and 2), they enjoyed very much
you could have mcdonald at the entrance, plus convenience store



the entrance fee is only twd65
very cheap and worth it
and very good location where public transport can arrive at almost door step



the pandas always take you away, cute and cuddly gentle giants are a must see in this zoo
its nice to spend half a day there but don't get your expectations too high
there are tons of animals to see yet not all are in the best conditions
a lot of cages were smelly and unattended by the staff and i felt sad for a couple of the creatures living there



went to the taipei zoo to see the panda that gave birth last year
we were not expecting to see a dozen or more koalas in that zoo
for a zoo that you have to pay only $nt60 per adult, this zoo is very well maintained by the government of taiwan
the zoo has a lot of animals that are not entirely imprisoned in cages
they also have pink flamingos and camels :)


most excellent zoo
animals in reasonably large facilities, beautiful gardens and easy to get to
would be worth it even without the baby panda
also very cheap at 60nt



honestly, i don't even remember the animals! the grounds were lovely with orchids growing everywhere
a very pleasant place for an afternoon stroll
and very easy to get to because the mrt stops just outside



this is our second time here (first time was in 2008) and the zoo was still as enjoyable as the first time
a wide variety of animals and facilities (although the cable car was under maintenance when we were there in april)
the food options are a little limited - either mcdonalds or a small cafe in the panda building, or various vending machines
easy to reach at the end of the brown mrt line



well maintained with a great layout
the panda exhibit was well planned with tickets for entry based on a time slot so you could enjoy the experience
well staffed, clean and inexpensive for clean family fun



never been a big fans of seeing animals trapped in cages
this place turned out to be quite an awesome experience
my suggestion is to rent a stroller especially if you have kids who need to nap
cost of the rental is only 50twd
it's worth every cent especially when your child is being difficult and unwilling to walk
the exhibits were good and laid out in an orderly fashion
i do very much appreciate the queing system for the panda exhibits but quite disappointed when we were herded through the line
vending machines were everywhere and quite suprised the zoo didn't charge an arm and a leg
the food available will fill your stomach and keep you going till the next meal
there were some mainland prc tourists who tried to jump the queue but not too serious
you can easily spend a whole day there
again, for less than 100twd entrance fee, i'm content
the zoo is easily accessible by subway and buses from taipei 101 area



it was a really big place with very few animals not in sight,a lot of dilapidated buildings
for the gate fee though,one should not expect much
the upside of the experience is the train ride for which one enters a one way ride for 5ntd and another 5 downwards,the pandas and the vast space encourages walking which is healthy
all this exempted it wasn't such a cool experience



very nice huge zoo, admission price is very reasonable (less than $3 or 60 taiwan dollars)
grounds are vast and animals are wide spread out, but very nice to walk around
baby panda had the longest lines for obvious reasons, and was adorable, but sleeping on top of a bamboo tree, mom walking around and eating bamboo; unforunately security guard doesn't give you much time, other than to take some pictures, sort of like an assembly line
but well worth an hour visit
tiger is also worth the walk up the hill a spell!


a very nice day trip to the zoo, despite the place being very full due to a bank holiday with free entry for children
the zoo is so big we were still able to see everything without too much queuing
factor in at least 6 hours to walk around and see everything and have a bit of lunch
at $60 to get in, it is a very good deal
all animals look well cared for, and have plenty to entertain them unlike at other zoos where animals can appear bored
of course the baby panda was the star attraction, but there is an amazing selection of species from all over the world, including a taiwanese section which was interesting for tourists to see local flora and fauna, and for locals to see what exists and is being conserved in their own habitat
as an animal lover, i can say this rates as one of the best zoos i have ever visited and would reccommend a visit if you have the time when in taipei



it was nice normal zoo, with cheap prices
if you like asian animals, thats your place
especially gibbons and malesian honey bear were our favorites



the zoo was very clean and well kept
the landscape was beautiful
i was lucky and got some good photos of the pandas



a big big biggest zoo i've visit in my life because i can't finished walking and about halfway i gave up, it's tiring and crowded during weekends
but still very nice place to see and explore



having visited zoos in san diego, chicago, houston and new york, i was surprised at how big the taipei zoo is
it is easily reached by the brown line on the mrt and costs only 60 taiwanese dollars to get in
the star of the moment is yuan zai, the baby panda
after purchasing your zoo ticket, you will be given a white ticket with your scheduled "panda visit" in the panda house
maps in english are available at the information center
takes 5-8 minutes to walk there
my visit took place on a thursday when many school groups appear
i would imagine that on weekends, it is equally crowded with families
my panda visiting time was 9:50 am and i stood on line for 10 minutes
when i passed the area at 11:40 am, there was absolutely no line as most of the kids had already seen the panda and the tour buses had left
the panda house is circular and air conditioned inside
afterwards, i went to the koala house where i saw a mommy and baby koala
at the hippo area, there was another mom and baby duo
so many photo opportunities for animal lovers
shops in each area specialize in souvenirs for that zone - in other words, if you see something you like in the panda store, buy it because it will not be available elsewhere in the zoo
there is also a store specializing in penguin items, one for frogs, one for african animals, etc
there are many restrooms, a mcdonald's, other snack bars/restaurants, and seating for picnics
most families and all the school groups brought their own food
i managed to see only half the zoo because i wanted to ride the mao kong gondola starting from the 2nd stop which is near the penguin area
i could have spent all day here



the location of the zoo on this app's map is currently wrong, so look for taipei zoo mrt station, instead! i went there yesterday via mrt to see pandas



visit taipei zoo was a nice experience even if the more i visit zoo the more i wish they would never exist, but i leave to each of you and to your conscience the zoo problem!the place is very easy to reach by mrt and very pleasant to walk around ! there are many animals that i didn't see before and entrance price was good enough!if is your first time in south east and like me you are coming from far away, visit this zoo is a good way to know more about animals from that side of the world! (i was there in november 2011)


my sister and i had a really great time here despite having many friends and family members questioning our decision
the taipei zoo was well designed and it was easy getting from one attraction to the next
we got to see 'duan duan' and 'yuan zai' the pandas! make sure you buy a ticket to see them at the entrance (designated time slots) otherwise they might not let you wait in line
you don't have to worry about food as there are heaps to choose from
there are cafes (eg: panda cafe, frog cafe etc) to complement each section and we had custard puffs in the shape of pandas!


the zoo was larger than i expected and well laid out with the enclosures being modern and clean
be prepared to walk unless you want to join the endless queue for the zoo train
the zoo is located on the side of a hill with a steady incline from just past the entry gates to the rear sections
the metro takes you right to the front gate and the entry fee is very cheap
plan for at least half a day



get to the last line of brown line station of taipei zoo and walk for 5mins to get to the zoo
entrance fee is pretty cheap and it's a big zoo to walk around and spend time with the animals
there is the maokong panda as well, it's fun!


easy to go with metro and very cheap - nt$30 with student card, even normal just nt$60
to see pandas you have to line in, the pandas are behind a glass and the staff rushes you, so not very pleasant experience
however, there are lots of animals and you can get quite close some of them
good attraction especially for children



all museum in taipei are closed on monday, but this zoo is open, and cheap
student is $1, older is free, regular price $2
we spent 4 hours there
my 19 yrs daughter & 74 yrs mother had a great time



this is a perfect "escape from city life" activity leaving the crowded city life of taipei into the wild and natural place of the city

you should definitely pay a visit and observe the pandas here (not all but most of which were sent off from china as a present)
you can use the public metro or mrt to reach this place and the entrance fee is quite reasonable



a great day outing



lots of animals to see



lots of shade to sit in



lots of concession stands


air conditioned buildings


great family spot and only $2 bucks



unlike american zoos!


at any other time, it's probably a great place to visit
but with the wet weather, lack of shelter, and the numerous constructions going on, it just wasn't as wonderful as expected
and it was very crowded although a weekday as bus loads of kindy kids were there
almost the whole zoo was filled with kindy kids and teachers
that also caused the wait (in the rain) to the special panda exhibition to be extra long, so we decided to skip it
too much of a hassle to queue up in the rain
having said that, the animals generally looked well taken care of, and enclosures are ok and feel safe to approach
plenty of washrooms and kiosks that sell food



easy access from metro
ability to purchase time slot to see baby panda
we were able to go freely about park
spookish was the pythons were wrapped all over trees and limbs and wasnt too sure one might actually join us in the viewing hut



i am not a fan of zoos, preferring to see animals in their natural habitat but i have to say as zoos go, this one is pretty well run and the enclosures are staged in such a way, as to mimic the natural habitat of the animals
judging by the large groups of schoolchildren visiting the zoo on the day i visited, this zoo serves to educate the children on these animals and their habitat



not really a fan of zoos but they did a good job in keeping this place well maintained
the animals looked well taken cared of
the facilities were clean and staffs were helpful
it is also easily accessible by train
we took our 2 year old daughter to her first zoo visit and i think it made a good impression
it has a good variety of animals but our favorite was the cute panda
be prepared for long walks around the zoo as it is quite big
but there are several places where you can rest
they are actually very nice to rest in and have a quick bite or have some drinks before continuing on
overall a very nice experience but i can only recommend going there once as a tourist



a zoo with a lot of animals, special showing of pandas
place is very crowded with people, especially china tourists
ticket was a good deal
accessible by train



the zoo is huge, lots of animals, the ticket is so cheap, and it includes entry to panda house too! this is one of the best place for kids, we spent few hours here and only managed to visit half of the zoo
my kids already request to come back again on next visit:-)


was a really nice zoo, was very well designed and all the staff were very friendly, its spacious so there was not a problem with crowds
was very impressed with the food choices all round the zoo aswell as drinks for sale and free water
was interesting to see a mcdonalds there but quite convenient at a zoo too! the shop was great too, had such a good selection of animal related toys
we were impressed with taipei compared to some other places, everyone was so friendly and civilised!


a really cheap zoo with excellent pens for the animals
they are all open and comfortable and all animals look well cared for etc



the largest zoo in asia, this was original a private zoological garden
the giant panda house, formosan animal area, koala house and asian tropical rainforest area are of particular note
there are many activities for young children
he zoo is unbelievably inexpensive and affords great opportunities to see and learn about pandas
it's probably a better display than i've seen in the united states
the panda hours are shorter than those for the zoo as a whole so don't wait too late to go
you'll be given timed entry for the panda area
enjoy the time outside as much as possible as you'll be moved along at a steady pace once inside the panda building



if you ever wanted to see a giant panda, here's a great place to do it
i got there just before 4pm (last visitor entry is at 4pm) so the visitor numbers were not as dense as what they might have been earlier in the day
you receive a little ticket with a time stamp on it which is your allocated time block for entry to the giant panda house
this queuing system is necessary to manage the (19,000 daily) visitors in smaller groups and they have to keep people moving along so that others can have a chance to view this special cub & mum pair
my main purpose for visiting taipei zoo was to view a giant panda and seeing the cub as well was a real treat! as it was late in the day, i did not venture around other parts of the zoo
it was a special experience just being able to observe the cub and her mum
highly recommended for the animal enthusiast



the zoo is really huge and is very well organised
my reason to visit was the lovely giant pandas a main draw for this zoo
a great weekend full day hangout



cheap entrance, easy to locate from mrt stop and you get a time slot to visit the pandas
also you can pay for the entrance on your mrt card
we have been to lots of zoos and this one is outstanding
you can catch a little train to the top and walk back down
the animals and birds were loved and probably pampered by the look of them! there are lots of,little eating places and picnic tables along the route and the toilets are plentiful and clean
we were here for about 3 hours and loved every minute of it
it was a monday and there were lots of,little children in school groups - all having a delightful time
viewing times for the mother and baby panda were strictly adhered to and we were not rushed through
excellent zoo with a great collection



good place to go with your friends, and easy to spend more than couple of hours walking around, even you have to rush to see all the animals in the zoo
nice food, good weather in the spring, literally a place to enjoy and relax with some friends



the zoo is unbelievably inexpensive and affords great opportunities to see and learn about pandas
it's probably a better display than i've seen in the united states
the panda hours are shorter than those for the zoo as a whole so don't wait too late to go
you'll be given timed entry for the panda area
enjoy the time outside as much as possible as you'll be moved along at a steady pace once inside the panda building



it was in the middle of the summer when i was here so was very hot! the mist system throughout the zoo was very good which meant i was able to enjoy it much more than i would have
all the animals appear to be treated well and it was very clean



when you get in, you will be give a kind of receipt with a time on it; that's your ticket to go see the pandas
don't lose it and go there by the time written on it
actually, you may not see much when you go see the pandas
besides being rare animals, it wasn't exciting at all
anyway, the entrance fee is so cheap you'd be crazy not to spend at least a few hours there
the zoo itself is nice and really big
we arrived later in the morning and didn't have time to go everywhere
there was some construction/renovation when we were there (end of feb
2014), but it didn't affect too much our visit
if i had time, i would go back to finish visiting the parts i didn't have time to see



it was fairly average but the animals were kept in relatively good conditions and the price was super cheap
maybe worth it on days where it wouldn't be busy but probably not worth it in the holidays 



the taipei zoo's entrance fee is probably one of the cheapest in the world! entrance fee is only 60 nt (about 2 usd)! the zoo is relatively well-maintained and there are quite a huge variety of animals inside
it is also worth seeing the baby panda yuan zai
there are a lot of vendo machines around the zoo, although restaurants are not too many
if you want to visit the whole zoo, you will need to be there the whole day
the zoo closes at 5pm, but the indoor viewing areas close by 4:30 pm



the zoo was rather big but entrance ticket is really one of the lowest in the world
was crowded on a saturday afternoon, visited the panda, elephant and koala enclosures
nice friendly staffs at the giftshop
good for a visit if you have ample time during your trip in taipei


it was raining , animals were very lazy and they hidden from rain , we were waiting for the poor panda , eventually we left without seeing it 



not an amazing zoo as it lacks great habitats for most of the animals, but a fine 1/2 day attraction with the kids
lots of walking, as the exhibits aren't very efficiently arranged
got to see the baby panda, which was fun, and they handle the crowds well with the ticket and time system, even if it means only a walk-by look



we went during cny period and there were many people, yet traffic was quite well arranged
it was a pity that we didn't manage to get a ticket to visit the new born panda but there were also lots to see
nice place to be with kids



you have to take a ticket issued before you can squeeze yourself in and view the baby panda at close range, but just for a few minutes! too many people!


we went over the lunar new year holiday (maybe not recommended) we only saw a fraction of the zoo
but what we did see what great
our two year old son loved it


actually i think we enjoyed it as much as he did
there are food areas throughout the zoo
you can take a train to skip a lot of the walking
we chose to walk everywhere



if you want to take the cable car to go into the zoo, i suggest you not to go on a monday as the cable cars are on maintenance on every monday
there are some people selling small sovenoirs outside the zoo and you can bargain to get a good price
the ticket is very cheap compared to the one in singapore and we went in to see the pandas!!!


the zoo is easy to access on mrt
on a sunny saturday morning in january, the zoo was busy, with a 10-15 minute line to see the pandas
the other animals have probably developed inferiority complexes by now, because the pandas get by far the most attention
one is hustled along past the indoor and outdoor pandas by the shouting staff to keep the wait time short
the enclosures are, for the most part, quite spacious and filled with plants and trees, so in some cases the animals are obscured by vegetation and hard to see
as one might expect, the zoo is particularly strong on taiwanese animals; for example, the taiwanese boar, which is almost extinct in the wild due to interbreeding with domesticated boar, is well-represented and described
the zoo is strong on educational exhibits geared to children
parts of the zoo are a bit worn; for example, the insectarium, but the butterflies there are beautiful
chains such as macdonald's account for most of the food
the entry price is incredibly low, representing great value
i have visited a lot of zoos throughout the world - amsterdam, berlin, san diego, and washington being some of my favorites
the taipei zoo may not be quite at that level, but it is close, and for the price can't be beat



we made a day trip to the zoo, combining with maokong gondola, and had a great time
our kids (four and seven) enjoyed it very much
keep in mind though, this is a big zoo, and you're going to do a lot of walking
we managed to see all of the exhibits at a fair pace, and it took us 4 hours total
please be careful, if you intend to ride the train, however
the train rides are one-way only, and you must get off and wait in line to re-board if you want a round-trip back to the original station
we made the mistake of getting on the train right before closing, which took us to the other station, and there is a huge line (at least 30 min) to get back, so we ended up walking back to the original station which took almost 20 min



large zoo on the side of a hill
separating animals by countries of origin
i went to see the giant panda, we were given a 9 minute window to see them and told to move along when stopped to take a photo


we saw the new baby pandaaaaa, it was sleeping though and everyone lined up to see it
looooong line but worth it
huge zoo



1
 cheap entrance fee- affordable outing for a whole family2
the highlights were the pandas; hence every visitor was given a time slot to enter
i wish we were given more tine to view the pandas and read the information provided
the officers kept pushing people through so i just had a glimpse of yuan zhai, and unable to read the many story boards available
3
 a lot of construction going on with at least 3-4 sights closed


i disagree with a lot of people, i do not think that this is a great zoo or a good place for the animals to live
yes, they have a wide range of animals and yes they do have many of them, but this is not necessarily a good thing
considering the amount of animals they have in some cages, they should really expand either the cage or divide the animals up
when looking at the animals in their cages i can not feel anything but sad, especially the koala's who only has a few square meters, one tree and a few branches to clime on
the zoo has big aisles for people to walk on and have made it very simply for its guests, but everything seems a little dated and the variety of food is a little boring



i have been to zoos all over the world and this is a top three
there are tons of animals
they are healthy and active
they have pandas! the grounds are beautiful and well kept
be prepared, if you are a westerner, children there will treat you like a purple alien
i have never had so many people, stare, shout at me and ask to take my picture
it was bizarre
however, that isn't the zoo's fault, but rather perhaps a lack of etiquette amongst the taiwanese



the zoo was spacious and clean
the animals were kept in big spacious enclosures
the entrance tickets are priced at nt$60 per adult and nt$30 for children
comparing with zoos in other countries, taipei zoo is so cheap and yet it is so well kept with many animals and wide space to walk around
there were many shops selling refreshment and souvenir everywhere in the zoo
at nt$60, it is definitely one of the best and cheapest zoos
when we we were there, the six month old born in taiwan panda bear was making its third day debut appearance
although there was a big crowd, there was orderly and systematic queuing to get into the panda enclosure to see the baby panda
the officials controlling the crowd did a very good job controlling the crowd
we managed to get many good photos of the cute baby panda and its mummy panda



after reading many positive reviews, we were disappointed when we arrived
the cheap entry fee makes it good value, but the construction outside and most of the facilities look 30 years old
the zoo is very good for viewing african animals - a tiger, a lion, a leopard, plenty of hippos, elephants, giraffes and camels
but there was sadly only one panda sleeping in the big enclosure, so you can only take a photo from 40m away through glass
the zoo is very large and spread out, and the signs and directions are very poor
at least the food stands were reasonably priced, there is even a mcdonalds there



very large and beautiful zoo! went on a drizzly weekday, not crowded
lots of animals, and of course, the pandas
disappointed only in the rundown insect house, expected more creatures there
you can't beat the low entry fee and the availability of all kinds of food and snacks
hope you get a chance to enjoy the zoo!


the admission fee is extremely inexpensive! if you're a student, don't forget to bring an international student card because they don't accept other student cards
the zoo is very large with a variety of animals and food outlets including a 7-11! however, the way the enclosures are built its hard to see most of the animals
wasn't able to see the baby panda, which was disappointing
having been to many zoos around the world, this zoo was average for me
take the mini train inside for $5nt on your way to the exit because it can get tiring walking around as the zoo is huge
try to get there before the crowds start building up, especially on weekends
i don't think this a must-see if you have already been to a few zoos



at first, i think the zoo is a small one but in fact it is quite large and there is a large variety of animals inside
the facility is quite tired and the living environment for animals is small
however, it is still a good attraction for kids for half day



i know it's unfair to compare it to the other zoos in other cities
but think about the economic strength of taiwan, it needs to upgrade its zoo and make it comparable at least to bangkok, not to mention singapore
particularly when there is land around and a spectrum of animals to display



amazing amount to see for $60nt
you can spend anywhere from 2-5 hours (depending on how long your kids want to stay)
we used to go a few times a year when we lived in taoyuan, and our son was always excited
the only "bad" time to go is when it's hot--there are few places to cool down (the penguin enclosure) as it's muggy: the air doesn't move at all
we made friends with the convenience store clerks as we tried to get up energy to see more
food inside is typically expensive/poor quality



for a ticket price of nt60, i was expecting a small zoo


perhaps 3-4 enclosures
boy, i was so wrong! the zoo was so huge, and a 3 hour visit was barely enough to do it justice
do take note of the zoo layout (not on flat ground)
a smart way to tour the zoo is to take the 5min tram ride (nt5 per person, pay on the bus) from the main station to the bird word station, and then make your way down
this minimizes upslope walks
we really liked the african animal area
the animals were pretty cooperative that day and moved very close to us, perfect for close up shots!


it is really a fun place for kids
they had great fun! talked a lot about those animals they saw
loved to have this place in taipei
so convenient to go there



panda exhibits layout could be improved, hk oceanpark layout is better in that it allows a clearer and nearer view of the pandas activities
good varieties of animal species and zoo on the whole well kept and clean



its a very grey and tired looking zoo
sorry to say for a cheap price, i may just give it another star
but other than that, there is no way it deserves another tick for me
agagin, this is a 100 yr old zoo so it probably just old
they are doing a lot of upgrading works now because they are celebrating the 100th anniversary next year
so go at your own disappointment



prosthe green activity for kids was quite engaging and my friend's 10 year old son had some fun
the reptile section is quite ok and provide much welcomed shelter from the relentless rain
the ride around the zoo is really cheap too
consit was rainy that day so that didn't help with the experience
there wasn't much shelter at all
the penguins look sad and all the animals look half-drown
very weird to place tropical bears right after penguin
while the bear areas look acceptable for the bears, the place where the visitors view the bear look to be more suitable for polar bear (all white)
most disappointing was that i can't see any pandas at all
i understand the mother and young panda cub will only be shown in jan 2014
 i was hoping to see at least the father but no such luck
the panda enclosure was totally close
there was 2 workers there explaining but they have serious signages issue


a good day trip if you're into zoos
wide range of exhibits although the place ios quite spread out
mrt line stops right at the entrance



my heart went out to some of sad-looking animals in the pathetically maintained enclosures
some had little space to move freely around, while other animals looked so bored
there were no animal feeding nor animal performance schedules while we were there on a weekend, not sure if they suspended it temporarily
however, the saving grace is that some of the animals were really quite cute and funny, we managed to catch some of them up to mischievous antics
also the entrance fee is really cheap and value for money, so there is no harm spending a couple hours here enroute to the maokong gondola
although the zoo is trying to upgrade and removate, it is taking a long time
we saw signs that the new enclosures are under removation and will only reopen 2 years later! that seems in a really long time and in the meanwhile, they were temporarily housed in cramped quarters
there should probably be more zookeepers/staff walking around as we saw a couple of youngsters disturbing the gorilla who was just sitting right in front of the glass window
those youngsters were taling loudly, making signs and using flash photography to irritate the gorilla and the gorilla was provoked into pounding the glass and bounding off to hide, much to the disappointment of visitors who arrived too late to catch much of it
we tried telling them to tone down their behaviour but to no avail





this was definitely worth the visit
it was a little cold and rainy when we went so the zoo was quite empty
we went primarily to check out the pandas but there was only one available for viewing and he was having his afternoon nap so not much happening there
the zoo is well maintained and is really impressive as far as zoos are concerned
at ntd60, per person, the zoo is extremely reasonable and worth a visit



it is a zoo, it has animals and is well maintained but does not have any "wow" factor
the education centre was fair enough and the staff in the insect section were memorable



i come from singapore where they say has the best zoo but honestly, i preferred the taipei zoo much more
large open spaces, many variety of animals from panda to koalas and bisons which i've never seen in singapore
mainly due to how large and cool the weather was, made the experience much better



we were wondering if we should skip the taipei zoo but the moment i mentioned the zoo, my kid got all so excited
kids somehow love any kinds of zoos
the taipei zoo is the last stop on 1 of the mrt lines and the moment we got to the station exit, we just have to turn right, walk for 2-3 minutes before seeing the entrance
we reached the zoo at 8
45am on a wednesday morning and i would advise folks to come early (opens at 9am) for the place gets busy with school kids and tourists shortly after 10
 we took the shuttle train ( further up from macdonalds ) up
when the train stopped, we alighted and viewed the various exhibits which were situated beside one another
then we made our way down by foot
it was pretty sunny in the 1st week for dec, but the cool weather made walking quite bearable
i was a little disappointed to see that the penguin's enclosure looking a little jaded and small
only 1 panda was outdoors playing when we were there
water coolers are located in some parts of the zoo
perhaps we went too early, but most of the animals were still hibernating away



we went to the zoo on the 23/nov which was a sat so the zoo was very crowded
try to avoid going on weekends (since the price is only nt$60, many taiwanese like going to the zoo for family trip, i know i would as it is so much cheaper than the one in my country,, haha

)we used our easycard to tap and enter the zoo, it is so much easier and we could save time as there is no need to q and buy tickets!)note : the whole zoo is huge and it is very tiring to walk around to see all the animals

haha

we did our best and we took in the koalas, panda (only 1 as the mummy panda : yuan yuan is nursing her new baby : yuan zai

both mother and baby panda is scheduled to make their public appearance in jan 2014

), the penguins and whole lot of other animals

haha

what we like about the place is that there are a lot of places to sit and rest as well as shops selling snacks and drinks

it feels like a picnic area with so many kids and family around

it gives off a very family friendly atmosphere

haha

ps 2: if you like panda, buy the panda toys and items here, they are at least half the price of the same items that are sold at the panda shop in river safari singapore

and the soft toys sold are of the new baby : yuan zai

the taiwanese sure are proud of their new baby panda! this is a very nice place to visit if you have time to spare in your taiwan holiday

after going to the zoo, go to the maokong gondola for a nice trip up to maokong for tea and views

haha




it was raining on the summer day we visited the zoo so there weren't as many people and it was a little cooler than normal
it was easily accessible from downtown taipei by the metro
it cost 60 nt to get in
we took the tram to the top of the hill and then walked down to the bottom of the hill to catch all of the exhibits
i've been to a lot of zoos and for some reason this one just did not excite me
the highlight was supposed to be the pandas but there was a large crowd and they rushed you pass the panda in such a short time
favorite part was the reptile area
there was a stand outside that sold cakes on a stick resembling a panda and dried squid
this may not sound great but it was pretty good
the panda cake was actually the highlight for me which is why this was not one of my favorite zoos



it's not too bad for the entrance fee (nt$60 for adults)
quite a wide variety of animals
easily accessible by mrt
i especially enjoyed the reptile enclosure because of all the various tortoises
it's closed on mondays (if i remember correctly) so for those who are intending to visit the zoo, do avoid going on a monday



the zoo is pretty big and has a lot of attractions
the plus point is it's nice to walk around in the cool nov weather
the attractions are standard stuff which you see in most zoo around the world
i come from singapore, and i think the singapore is much better and well organized by creating a buzz
taipei zoo also looks dated and it's time for a face lift ( i see some construction works going on there in nov 2013)


we took the mrt from the city which was a lovely trip in itself as you go up the mountains out of the city to the zoo
we went on a sunday, entrance fee was 60 twd each which is very very cheap compared to any other zoo in australia or england we have visited
the zoo is very big and yes there are lots of walks around which all were really lovely
lots of plants and trees not forgetting the animals too
as it was a sunday it was very crowded
if you don't enjoy crowds go if u can on a weekday
there are lots of eateries within the grounds as well
the queues to see the panda were very long so we skipped that but we saw pretty much as the other animals
the animals all looked pretty well fed and were in large open areas
definately would recommend this to see



we visited in late nov
the main purpose was to see the panda at the zoo
transportation wise, it was convenient as the transit took us all the way to the entrance of the zoo
tickets was affordable compared to many other zoos
we paid a fraction of what we would have paid back home
the weather was cool and this made walking around the zoo pleasant
visitors can also take the tram in the zoo at a super affordable price of nt10 per person



i just hated this zoo
first of all it's covered in a big area and you have to walk for most part
the directions inside the zoo are not the best and you will find yourself walking a lot
very few animals and all of them did not look much healthy
we especially went to see the panda and were disappointed
huge area dedicated to the panda with several sub section and what do we find


only 1 panda on display
then 1 tiger, 1 leopard


so on so forth
after walking for almost 2 hrs, going in circles, we made a hasty exit



big zoo with a huge good variety and interest for childerns but heavily crowded especially on sunny weekends, so be careful if you have group of kids or naughty ones!easy to reach as taipei zoo mrt station is just opposite to taipei zoo on brown line, easily access by taxi and car also! you must carry some food if you are not big fan of junk food or mcdonalds which always has long queue(may be you need to wait for more then 30 min
)don't miss the pandas, african elephant and gorilla at taipei zoo, a good place to spend time with family



i was a little doubtful when my friend suggested going to taipei zoo (having been a little put off by certain other asian "zoos" i have seen
anyway after taking the mtr directly to the entrance (almost) of the facility, i was very pleasantly surprised!the animals are well kept in fairly spacious compounds and more work is being done to further improve the facilities
right now a new hippo enclosure is well underway
apart from missing out on the sealions, becuase of the "massive" queue, we explored the whole area
it was a very hot and extremely busy day there but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
recommended



there was just one lonely panda when i visited and even he seemed to be dodging the cameras
huge place but animals were mostly sleeping in the day
the formosan area was quite interesting but most enclosures had just one animal or none at all
part of the zoo was under renovation
plan to spend about 3 hours here if you plan to stroll around leisurely
else there's a train to take visitors around
couple this with a trip to maokong for afternoon tea if the weather is good



big zoo but not that special i think
just like many others but bigger
they have a mc donalds and 7/11 inside wich i found funny
you can pay with easycard so you don't have wait in line for a ticket
the butterflygarden was really nice though



for a place which cost < s$8 (family of 4) for a good day of fun, it is definitely a must visit place of interest for family with young children
it is huge and takes quite a long time if you walk
you may want to consider taking the zoo bus which cost nt$5 per person
this is the best and most worthy place i visited in taipei



was our 2nd visits to taiwan, had covered most of the popular attraction
so, we decide to go maokong in this trip
since this zoo was just beside it, so we decided add on to our trip to see the pandas as the entrance fee is only 60nt for adult
by looking at the map, we thought it was a small zoo for young kids, so we thought we could complete it within1hr or less
surprisingly, there are many different types of animals and most of them are enclosed in a natural environment setting
the train ride is only 5nt ! even though there isn't any animal show available, we still enjoyed the visits very much, as most of the animals were awake except the bears
you won't need any nicely printed map as we can easily follow the walking track to see the next animals
also
drinks at the vending machine is mostly 30nt, very reasonable price
importantly, the souvenirs are cute and are reasonable price too!


yeh that's right, just $60nt entry, or $2us! the place is huge too, has a little train to get from one end to the other
animals have good size enclosures, the hippos are getting a new and bigger one built as we speak
they're all in good condition which is always good to see
the leopard was a personal favourite, beautiful cat
just jump on the mrt and you're there in about 15 from the city


a perfect place for families and friends, for weekends or just a getaway
it is easily accessible by mrt and well-designed to offer convenient and inexpensive recreation for bored adults, and amazing and fun discoveries for students and kids
this spacious zoo may take you a long walk to see everything (beware of the hills), so be well-prepared
besides the open areas for wild animals and birds, there are also pavilons for different and interesting species, for example, butterflies and snakes
you can bring your own food and drinks, or you can choose those sold in the zoo
you can also relax yourselves under the shady trees and on the meadows, with patches and patches of colorful flowers here and there to please your eyes
a satisfying trip worth all the exhaustion!


cheap and educational for children
convenient and easy accessible by mrt
food is available at reasonable price
should go if time permitted


we went there not expecting anything but were surprised at the size of the zoo
there were many animals too see
however we were disappointed that their videos about the animals were all in chinese



zoo was large and have excellent layout
however there were simply not enough animals displayed
we went during the taiwan national day and the place was packed
we patiently waited for a long line at the panda enclosure building only to come across 2 glass enclosures
1 had no pandas
the other had one that was sleeping facing the other way
for such a nice building, there should be more pandas kept



i not a huge zoo fan, however this is a really good one
lots of space, a real focus on preservation and the environment
well signed in english also, with some great special areas (the baby panda site is fantastic) good food options here for the all types when taking a break
also very little animal smells! odd but this zoo is so much better than most others i've been too



go to see animals


what else? :) also you can eat there and take the gondola for a ride and a sky view to the taipei city
amazing place to visit but a lot of people on weekends so you might find a cue to see the panda etc
so better if you can go during working days
in 2014 they will open few new areas
and also the baby panda born now would be possible to be seen
entrance is 60 nt$ for adults



be there earlier so you get to take the shuttle and walk from peak to down
it will be the easiest and less tiring way in visiting the zoo
i was there around 10
30 so a lot of school child age from 4 to 12 is having their day tour with teacher and so on
you can't get to the shuttle as they are too many
then you have to walk by your own to get up
baby panda is still with his mama, so you will be only see the panda papa



we rarely go to a zoo when we travel abroad
but this travel, we tried the taipei zoo after coming down from the maokong gondola ride
there were many parents with kids as that is a saturday
the zoo was quite big, and is still under renovation
what a lovely place to go with kids
and the place is also clean with clean public toilets



this zoo features large enclosures in a picturesque setting
although there is a tram to take you to various areas there is still a significant amount of walking each regional section provides a cross section of animals so it would take a full day to see all of the areas
there are english signs which provide interesting information



i like this zoo
all the things inside is worth for the 60 ntd that we pay, no additional payment, except for the shuttle train and maokong gondola
a lot of types of animal



i really like this zoo, most animals seem reasonably happy, the setting of the whole park is very lush
monkeys and lemurs are always fun to watch
entrance is us$2 for adults, $1 for kids



i am comparing taipei zoo with singapore zoo (which we visited in august 2013) and ocean park in hong kong (that's where i am from)
taipei zoo is a bit run down, not as new as the other two, but it is big and the animals seem to be in a more natural state
there is less of a pressure to please the tourists - which means it is less "artificial" in terms of the environment
kids will love seeing the panda (a lot closer than you can see in singaporezoo / hong kong ocean park), checking out african animals, experience butterflies flying in the garden, seeing fun bugs etc
the downside is they don't have feeding sessions for tourists and there are no performances but that would mean the visitors are spreaded out in any given time - whereas in singapore zoo, for example, certain places can get crowded after a show ends
the zoo is so big that we cannot finish seeing everything (our 3 year old was complaining of fatigue!)



i can feel the happiness of animals,as they all grow well and fat
i visited few zoo before, for this taipei zoo, i can really see the different
they try to make the zoo just like the animals' home
they give the space for them
for me, this is very important
the entrance fee is unbelievable cheap, nt60 only
you can spare whole day there, walk-rest-walk again
the zoo provides enough benches for you to take a rest
for those who prepare own food, can have it at picnic zone
for those who are not prepare own food, can simply get a cup of instant mee at convenient shop
the price is all same like other places, not extra charges for tourists
if you have youth cards,please show it then can get special discount for the entrance tickets



a very cheap zoo to visit, but ruined by the low maintenance feel of the place
it is also very big, but unfortunately it seem that some of the cage/enclosure didn't have any animals, which means that you are sometimes looking at nothing
it does not have atmosphere of a zoo too, ie it does not generate excitement, even for the 12 year kid in my family
if you have been to singapoo zoo you will know what i mean
good if you have time to spare, otherwise recommend giving it a miss



like so much of the infrastructure in this city, the high speed rail worked flawlessly to take us to the zoo and the route passes through some interesting parts of the city you might not otherwise see
i reside in a city that arguably has the world's best zoo (no, not congress in washington, dc) but this one was still worth a visit
in san diego's zoo the pandas are shy and distant and spend much of their time eating bamboo leaves
in taipei the huge structure for the pandas allow visitors to get up close to the windows and view the animals directly and to take up close pictures
the pandas on the day we visited were anything but shy!the rest of the zoo was very well designed with modern natural settings for the animals to roam around in
there were also attractive small lakes and gardens quite peaceful and serene
note: the day we visited had temperatures that were setting records for the highest temperatures every recorded in the city ever
there were not many areas to escape the heat so if you're going during a heat wave bring a hat and sunscreen and lots of water



we visit taipei zoo on 10/10, taiwan national day, so ticket only cost nt30, i think cheapest in the world
many people on that day since it's their holiday
however not so crowd because the zoo is big enough
a lot of animals like panda, leopard, penguin and wolf that seldom see in my country
queue for riding train is very long but not need to wait so long
can visit together maokung cable car, there is a cable car station link to mao kung inside the zoo



great value for money, and really good exercise
for the most part, the exhibits are modern and appear well kept
more information could be given on the animals, and there was a noticeable lack of staff outside of the gift shop/food areas



very well kept zoo with lots of tropical plants around the zoo grounds
has also got lots of exotic animals from africa
female panda has given birth afew months ago, so keep an eye out for a baby panda on display
the amphibians & reptiles section was full of information & interesting facts



the zoo is quite poorly maintain some animal are confined in small area
the zoo ticket is cheap (nt60)
i believe this is cheapest zoo to see panda
the panda is cute



it's an ordinary zoo with lots of animals i didn't expect
although it's a rainy day in april, there were many people in the morning
because of its spacious, we still felt comfortable in the crowd
i remembered it's a zoo with long history, however, i didn't find it old or in faded color
all facilities are well maintained
big place we had spent full day and felt exhausted
luckily we could take a train on our way back to main entrance
it would be perfect if we could leave the zoo by taking the maokong gondola
unfortunately, it was out of service at that time because bad weather
i think this zoo is also elder-friendly, coz it's easy to find a place for rest anywhere
my 2 kids (age 8 & 11) and i really had a great time there!


excellent zoo which is alot better than many others
can spend the whole day there, but yet not finish looking at all the attrcations
extremely big, with many animals, many pics to be taken
a must-go 
entrance fee is extremely cheap
just eat elsewhere before going because mac's always has long queues
downside is a long trip on the train system



a word of advice before i proceed: check their website before you decide on which day to go
why i say this is because we decided to go on a monday, when everyone was working & all the kids are studying
but what we didn't know was that the maokong gondola (cable car) wasn't working! & i really wanted to ride in a glass-bottomed cable car other than singapore's
there were a spectacular array of animals to be found
& trust me, coming from a photographer boyfriend, this is something really cool
we used 2 of our biggest memory cards to capture thousands of photos! some of the animals we didn't get to see anywhere else other than national geographic
p
s
if you love to see butterflies close up, go to this zoo
you'll be able to touch them :)


lots of animals and lots of walking
we had great weather at the beginning of october and enjoyed walking the vast grounds to burn off all the food we had eaten while vacationing! some animals were not able to be seen, but there are enough different animals that you will not be disappointed
i could imagine it would not be comfortable in the summer months



well, my title says it, i was there for the panda, because in singapore, you need to pay quite an expensive fee to to get into river safari to see the loaned panda
(note: river safari is not the singapore zoo)the zoo itself is quite big, but, you need to walk quite a distance to see another animal, unlike in singapore where the next animal is less than 5mins away from the last one
and because the fee is very cheap, i feel that there is not much maintenance done or maybe they are trying to keep the place as natural as possible for the animals
anyway, i did not walk the whole zoo as i cannot stand
once is enough, i will not go back



went here with my family at may 2013 and it was hot weather with around 36 degree celsius, have to walk under the blazing sun
the hippopotamus center was under construction so quite disappointing
the only thing i love is the panda center, the two pandas gifted from china mainland were very cute
other than that everything is just okay



this was very fun- only a couple bucks a person (usd) and very easy to get to taking the taipei subway line- it's at the end of one of the segments
some of the attractions close on different mondays, check in advance
if you like turtles or penguins or pandas etc check out the special stores dedicated to each animal- they had a ton of little gift shops! the food in the panda house was actually really good, too



a zoo with a lot of promise, but it does not deliver
it is not expensive to visit, but it should offer the visit much more than it does


we spent over half a day just wondering around in the zoo
my advise is see the panda early in the morning when it is quieter and they are more active in the morning
excellent place



got to see quite a variety of animals (not what i expected as i heard the zoo is small), so i am quite pleased!


it was one of the biggest zoos i've been to, and there were a lot of different animals
it takes a few hours to get through them all
it was really hot that day, like most days in taiwan, but it was still a great time
my daughter is always happy when we go to the zoo
i loved the panda! definitely the best part of the trip, but i didn't like that you couldn't stop for a moment to see it
we had to keep moving and if we wanted to take a picture we had to take it as we were walking by
but you could go back and see the panda as many times as you want
that was the only thing that bothered me because i was very excited to see the panda



great zoo and so damn cheap! spent 2 hours here and saw everything
the zoo is huge! great day and really good for a family



the weather was too hot and we were not able to visit the whole zoo
the zoo looks low maintained
some of the cages were empty without animals



good zoo and not so big so dont have to walk so much
is best to combine your travel with the cable car as just next to each other
my recommendation is first travel the cable car to the top station
then on the way return just get off at the zoo stop and start the zoo tour from there



the place is filled with great variety of animals and species! however the exhibits are quite spaced out so need wait to take tram or walk a distance

waiting is mostly what we did



we visited the zoo on a wednesday, it wasn't crowded at all
the zoo is stroller and wheelchair friendly with ramps, although it is an uphill walk so it got quite difficult in the stifling heat
uv umbrellas and shades are a must during the summer! we would have stayed for longer if it wasn't for the heat, but nonetheless great fun for children and adults, highly recommended!nt$60 entrance fee is just insanely cheap for a zoo - london zoo cost around 20 times that!you can hire strollers (nt$50 hire plus nt$500 deposit) and wheelchairs (nt$1000 deposit) just inside the entrance



the zoo is so large that we couldn't finish seeing all the animals as we started at 12 noon and the zoo closed at 5 pm
however, we had a good time to watch the panda, koala, hippo, moneys, plus many precious animals there
we especially enjoyed the butterfly place
once you entered the butterfly place, there are so many of them (and huge size!) flying around you! they don't seem to scared of human at all
one think i really like about this zoo is that you can see the animals mostly
in the bronx zoo of new york, you can hardly see them because their living area are so huge that you could hardly find where the animals are hiding
here, the animals usually not put in a case but a medium size living area so you can spot them easier
(except we think the bears should get a bigger place)the fee is very cheap
and that day we only pay for 2 people even we had 4 people
they said when you have 2 people you only pay for one
how nice!!


def
try to visit this zoo during weekdays
less crowded and you can take your time! 60 ntwn $ per person
that's great value
its also very close to maocong cable car



first of let me just say that entry fee was a bargain at $4
they had a great range of animals neatly organised according to region etc
the highlight was the panda
they have got a baby panda but not on show along with the mum but the dad was still there
all animals were healthy and most of them were out of hiding
it did start pouring so some kept hiding
the zoo staff did close a few pathways to ensure safety of visitors due to torrential rain
public transport is easy
from main taipei city i did have to change trains twice but easily and cheaply got to the zoo
parking is also available for those who drive
the gandola was not operational due to the torrential rain but i do hope the weathers clears by the weekend so i can ride it
the zoo is very clean
staff were everywhere cleaning and moping the rain etc
the cost of food inside the zoo is the same as mc donalds charges outside the zoo
they do have internal trains to help travel between locations in the zoo as its a massive place
i did not catch the internal train but the service is there
i would rate this zoo ahead of singapore zoo simply because of the cost of this zoo and singapore and they have just about the same animals and quality of encloses
ofcourse singapore has more money hence the non enclosure environment looks better
will i recomend - yeswill i visit again if i were to come to taiwan again - yes and yes


i went there on a field trip with some young kids and we had a great time! it would be nice for a family trip
i'm not sure how expensive it is but they offer a student discount! it's a typical zoo





it's not worth a special trip but it is right next to the mokong gondola



koala, panda, bison, rhino, penguin, bear, gorilla and everything else u should be seeing in a zoo can be found! what a good place to spend with
with a student id, we entered the zoo with only $30, which is damn cheap price!


it was fun because when we visited last august 6 if you avail one ticket there will be a free
so you will have two tickets for the price of one :)


great panda display and nice environment right off the last stop of the mrt line! the only thing that was a mixed blessing was the mcdonald's which was very crowded
we would have preferred a smaller local restaurant but our kids loved it!


the zoo is huge
we had a wonderful time in the zoo
we pay ntd 60 (rm6) for the entry, definitely worth to visit especially on weekday, u missed the crowd
the zoo is clean, the best zoo i've been to
i'm so happy to see pandas & penguins! the souvenirs shop is great! you can't miss this! we will definitely go again



taipei zoo was one of the highlights of my tour to asia
my family and i only went to see the giant pandas and their new born baby, however, the mother and the baby were asleep so they weren't on display
however, watching the male panda was really interesting as they are so rare! we wandered around the rest of the park and were amazing to see elephants, zebras, monkeys, hippos and much more! this zoo is very educational as it has so many animals and loads of information about them on the signs
the only regret i have is that i didn't spend the whole day here because it is so big



the entrance fee of this zoo is quite cheap (60nt$ for adult and 30nt$ for students)
this zoo is indeed a huge one as it took us a few hours to completely cover this place
unfortunately, the bird park inside the zoo was closed for maintenance due to the typhoon during our visiting day
the animals in this zoo were very lively and active
so i assume they were very healthy
panda is one of the must-see animal there but i wasn't lucky enough as it was sleeping behind a wooden block
moreover, hundred or thousand of people were crowded at the panda's house just to see panda for a few seconds
for me, cranes were the main attractive animals in this zoo as they are not usually found in this region
other worth-seeing animal is koala bears, but they sleep almost all the time
anyway, one should enjoy this trip if he/she likes animals
just take care by drinking more water in the zoo as taipei weather is too hot!


there are 2 ways to get into the zoo
one is via the normal entrance and one is when coming from the mountain
do not visit the zoo on a very warm day because the zoo is surrounded by mountains and that makes the place damp


in combination with the heat, it might cause you breathing problems
also, keep in mind that most of the animals are hinting there there is too much heat



this zoo is huge with a lot of animals
easy to get there with the mrt
admission is super cheap(around two dollars) and in the zoo there's "mini train" you can take to get to the other side of the zoo
there are also decent restaurants, mcdonald's and 7-11 nearby should you get hungry



this price can't be beat for opportunity to see panda, koala bear, eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, penguins and tons others!i recommend taking the in-house "train" one way to save energy at 10 ntd
it is quite a big zoo
also what's worth mentioning is the on-site convenience stores including 7-11 that have tons of snacks at regular price so you don't feel ripped off like whenever you go to tourist spots
awesome!we live in honolulu and have enjoyed the honolulu zoo all the time but we don't have the above animals or reasonably priced snacks



this place is huge and the variety of animals is incredible
they have maps in english which was very helpful
most of the enclosures looked pretty good, like the animals would be happy
the gorilla did make me really sad though, he was by himself and was carrying around a burlap blanket
he looked lonely
super cheap too, cost about $2 usd



this zoo is manageable in size, connects to the makong gondola, has a pair of pandas (although i only saw dad because mom was off with her newborn)
if it's very hot (when isn't it) take the "train" up towards the top instead of climbing
the animals are divided by habitat and source
most are not in cages
there's a mcdonalds near the entrance if you get hungry
admission is us $2 per person aqnd when i went it was buy one get one free
go and enjoy the day



great zoo for a small price
lots of animals and exhibits
saw one panda and enjoyed the panda shop



a super day out in the beautiful mountains on the edge of taipei
a very spacious zoo and all the animals seem to have roomy, appropriate enclosures
one tip - as the zoo is on the mountainside, take the little road train near the entrance, which will take you to the far end of the zoo
walk back downhill taking in the various areas
lots of shady areas and booths to buy food and drink throughout the zoo and ample loos
latest attraction is a new born panda, not yet on open view



easy to access by metro
inside the zoo, it's also easy to walk around everywhere with the buggy
as the zoo is big, they have little train taking you from the lower part to the higher part and vice versa
you have to pay for the train, but it doesn't cost much
will go back every time when we are in taiwan



if you have kids to entertain who may be getting bored of the shopping/eating routine of taipei, this is a great spot to visit
a wide variety of animals, very cheap and takes a while to get through



if you go to taipei with kids, don't miss the zoo!!! very cheap entrance fee and it's huge! panda bears, elephants, they've got a large variety animals to view



very clean environment with a wide variety of animals
must go with children, though enjoyable with friends as well!p
s
entrance tickets are super cheap! 60nt for two people
four of us only had to pay 120nt


if possible, give this a miss
there might be full of animals but either you can't see them or they are closed
this defeated the purpose of having such a big zoo but not able to engage visitor
i've been to all the major zoo in asia pacific and i have to give this a disappointment vote



this is a clean, spacious zoo with a wide variety of healthy animals, birds, insects, reptiles
the ticket fee is not much and it is at 2 mins walk from mrt station
overall a nice experience indeed!


we only paid 30twd with our youth card, normal adult rate is 60twd
for such a low price, this zoo is an attraction worth visiting
the animals are not caged up so that's pretty good
the tram within the zoo costs only 5twd and it's an cheap alternative to walking back to the entrance
there are also lockers located near the entrance
the food and drinks sold within the zoo is reasonably priced so i didn't feel ripped off
it's a pleasant visit on an overall
definitely worth visiting!


as the title goes, taipei zoo is the only zoo in taiwan and the largest one in taiwan
you cannot compare the size of taipei zoo with other tremendous zoos in foreign country for sure
but if you want to know more about taiwanese animals, you should not miss it!


i took my class of five-year-olds here this year
it was slightly rainy, but we had amazing fun in the versatile environment
on arrival, we went to the bathroom, and found the tramway
the kids loved the choo-choo train theme! next we spent time in the reptile house where we learned about snakes, turtles, and lizards
we then trekked to the the penguins, which was a group favorite
after that, we spent time scouting wolves, primates, giraffes, and elephants
the convenience store near the hippo garden was great, and we had a seat at a picnic table nearby
we enjoyed the natural-looking habitats for the animals
we spent an entire day here and still didn't see everything
on our way home, i thought about how much i would like to return here with my husband!


easily access from any part of taipei
very cheap ticket! cheap till me and my mum cannot believe it
huge zoo, didn't have time and energy to complete the whole place, plus summer too hot
would love to go back again on next trip



the zoo has mostly all the animals that are rarely seen in other zoo
if you're lucky, you get to see some animals upclose with only the glass to separate between you and the animal
though there were no animal shows of somewhat, but it's worth a visit if you're going to maokong



near by to nanjing e
road mrt station , taipei zoo is located at the mujha mrt station (there is a gondola also at the same mrt line ) a nice place to hangout with friends and family and pandas are worth to watch
african elephants and bengal tiger are also a eye candy for the visitors



try the crystal one where u can see below ur feets! not for the faint hearted
good money for such a plesant ride too~ shall go again some other time


lots to see at taipei zoo and the animals have lots of space, give yourself enough time as it closes at half four


for only nt60, you get to visit a zoo that's got almost everything
it's worth it just looking at the pandas but the other animals (e
g
penguins) are also there
good to spend a half day on



i enjoyed my visit here much more than expected
it was sweltering hot and humid, and it was raining on and off throughout the whole day
i had just come off the maokong gondola, and was tired
but i'm so glad we spent our afternoon here, and i actually wish we could have stayed longer
i went on a weekday, and there was barely a line upon entering
luckily, there was a nice woman selling hand fans for a few dollars, i sure got good use out of it--it was so hot! when you enter, you will see the mcdonalds, gift shop, and rest rooms
even on a weekday, these areas were pretty packed
there are many picnic tables and benches, but they are outdoors, so be prepared with water to stay hydrated and cool
if you walk further in the park, there is a small cafe inside the panda exhibit building--it's indoors, so there is ac
this was a life saver for us since we are not used to the hot weather
the cafe had a fairly quick wait, but it's not particularly spacious, so the tables fill up quite fast
the food is westernized, and the menu consisted mostly of pastas
i had the mushroom chicken pasta, and it was only average at best
the panda exhibit was my favorite
although, there were only 2 pandas, and you have to queue in a long line to see them, it is well worth it
i queued twice so i could get more time with the little cuties! there is a zoo staff member helping to direct the queue so that it goes by pretty quickly, so don't expect more than 1-2 minutes of time to get up close to the pandas
snap your pictures when you can, because before you know it your time is up and you have to move along
the panda building also houses more gift shops and restrooms
another highlight of my visit here were the formosan animals
i was raised to love and appreciate science and wildlife, so i have always been fascinated with zoology, therefore this was a definite must see for me--as it is quite a unique opportunity! i should also mention that i am always cautious when visiting "zoos", because i am uncomfortable with the concept of displacing animals from their true natural habitat, especially if it is profit oriented and not for true conservation purposes
however, all the animals and their zoo habitats seemed very well cared, healthy, and maintained
i would even say that the conditions here were more impressive than many zoos i have visited in the u
s
we even saw several zookeepers performing their duties, which was quite interesting to me
however, it would have been nice to learn more about conservation efforts, if any
not only would this be important for the zoo and researchers, but public awareness and education should be a key priority in my opinion
my advice is to spend as much time here as you can! there is a lot to see, and keep the weather in mind
i would have rather been able to go on a day without the rain and possibly cooler
even though it rained, and many patrons left the zoo, i tried to stay as long as possible
but this means some of the animals will be seeking shelter and won't be as visible
i really can't wait to visit again
it definitely feels like i could have spent more time with the animals
i can see this as a great place to bring your loved ones to share the experience and make some memories
i highly recommend it for everyone!


the taipei zoo was an unexpected pleasant surprise
we originally had gone out to see maokong mtn/gondola, but decided to hit the zoo up first
we arrived during feeding time, so the animals were quite active
we spent about 4-5 hours there and didn't even get to see everything by closing time
the admission is very reasonable
this is one of the only zoos that seemed like a more natural environment for many of the animals there
bring comfortable walking shoes and umbrella or rain ponchos, as it rained on and off the whole time we were there
because of the rain and thunder, the gondola up to maokong mountain was closed
the zoo was a great and reasonable alternative and quite fun and uncrowded in the rain
highly recommended for couples, family, or animal lovers!


weather too hot
the train ride only ferries us from one place to another
it doesnt stop in any stopover locations
:(


my husband and i visited for a full afternoon and the entry price was cheap, the zoo is quite large and not too busy, the only disappointing thing for me was not seeing the pandas as they were having a siesta behind a large tree, although can you blame them with lots of visitors staring at them
i did read some negative points on the zoo but i recommend to judge it for yourself
it was lovely to see the little children looking exited to see the animals


went with my kids on a hot summer morning in june
the zoo is conveniently connected to the mrt (taipei zoo station)
you can even use your stor value easy card to pay for admission into the zoo as well as the zoo tram rides
the zoo is located on a hill side
it would be easier to catch the zoo tram to the maokong gondola stop and walk downhill to explore the zoo
the panda enclosure, koala enclosure, reptile enclosure and the penguin enclosure are well worth a visit
a small map is printed behind the tickets (if you bought tickets)
there are copies of the map in english at the visitor centre
there are various water points providing cold, cool and hot water around the zoo
there are also many shops, snack points and rest areas around the zoo
be sure to check out the poop art and the talking urinals
there is also a mcdonald in the zoo if you need to satisfy your hunger
i would recommend at least 4 hours (if not a full day) to really cover the zoo
while you are there, why not try out the maokong gondola too :)


while the taipei zoo boasts a wide variety of animals, most were in too-small enclosures that were hardly outfitted well
animals were either sluggish or hiding
i'd recommend the nearby cable car over the zoo



i'm a big zoo person and this was one of the best zoos i've been to, especially for the price
lots of different animals
we were lucky enough to watch the male gorilla out on a bit of a show for us
it's over a big area and we spent the whole day wandering around
i would definitely recommend it!


came here with our toddler
spend about 4 hours here
it was very hot but not crowded at all
we went on a monday
hop in-out train were easily available with long queue
we spend most of our time at their indoor exhibition looking at pandas and penquins and only select a few outdoor ones which our boy fancy

like giraffe and zebra and brown bear
toilets were really clean, everywhere pram friendly and very cheap entrance fee
well worth a visit if you have children
though it is a rather old zoo, animals look happy, everything is clean and not smelly and very organised
you can rent wheelchair and prams very very cheap too



near by to nanjing e
road mrt station , taipei zoo is located at the mujha mrt station (there is a gondola also at the same mrt line ) a nice place to hangout with friends and family and pandas are worth to watch
african elephants and bengal tiger are also a eye candy for the visitors



not the best or most groundbreaking zoo i've ever been to but a great way to spend a couple hours and see some fantastic animals
they all seemed to be treated well and healthy, and most had a large enclosure to roam around in
the koala and panda exhibit in particular was great


spacious, with plenty of room for the animals, and extremely affordable to get in
visit on a monday, when the only guests will be a few school groups



to be honest, we just went to the zoo to see the pandas
we then stopped by the koala bears and then left since mother nature decided to downpour! if you have kids - a definite place to visit

easily accessible by tsr and will recommend to take the mao kong gondola up to the south entrance of the zoo and purchase your ticket there before starting your journey to tour around that place
it will be better to go there in the morning and you do see quite alot of kids who are there on educational trip
do prepare enough water as it could be rather tiring trying to cover the entire area else you could purchase drinks from the vending machine along the way
will recommend to go if you are going to taipei at least to see the panda and koala bears at affordable rate



easily accessible by the metro, just a few minutes walk away
a big zoo with lots of things to see and quite easy to navigate around
they have a large colourful map (in a few languages, you can ask for the english version) showing you the different attractions
as it is quite a big, i would suggest taking the train up to the top end and then start walking down (less tiring that way)
it is definitely worth visiting
one can easily spend the whole afternoon there
tip: if you are visiting taipei on your own, it is great to get the taipei pass which allows you to get on and off the metro and buses without worrying about the costs
it comes with very informative booklet containing info of how to get to certain tourist attractions
if the site is not near the metro, they will tell you what bus to take after you get out of the station



a quiet big zoo, can have a close distance with panda
it so interesting
kids will love it very much
however, try to prepare enough water and stroller for kids
they will so tired, just after visit



very well designed zoo i have ever been
there are several activities during day time and very nice place for family activity



this is one of the best zoo i've been to
the ground area is really big so be sure to allocated ample time! entrance fee is cheap and it's really worth the money



we loved our visit, admission was around $2
our kids are under 6 so for 5 people our total admission was $4! the park is huge so it took a lot of walking but there is a shuttle train that takes you around
so much greenery, it was so beautiful
lots of cute little play places for kids, and lots of things to take pics of
food all over the park, vending machines, and bathrooms with squat, western, and kids size toilets
my kids loved it, we can't wait to go back!


my family and i visited the zoo on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowd
the zoo is conveniently located right next to the taipei zoo mrt station, you can also take the gondola to another entrance if you fancy
it was raining on the day that we were there but there were many people selling umbrellas, toys and raincoats near the entrance so that wasn't a big problem
the entrance fee was really affordable (60nt)
we visited the tourist center and gotten a big map of the place
there was also a macdonald and convenience store near the entrance
taipei zoo was really big with the animals categorized by the areas they live in
there were also special buildings (with cooling aircon) within the zoo that focuses on pandas, insects and reptiles
the bird zone was under construction when i was there so we didn't see much there
my sister and i were really impressed with the enclosures: they were really big and made like the real environment
however, as a result, at times we have problem trying to find the animal
all the animals were properly labelled with chinese and english explanations and i like how certain animals were named and the introduction is made like they are introducing the animal personally (like the gibbons)
the area of taipei zoo is very vast and hilly at times but there are ample seats/rest/picnic zones throughout the place
there were vending machines, merchandise booths, and snack booths/convenience stalls as well so we could often take a break and rest
there is a internal train ride as well that cost a mere nt5 (one-way) if you feel tired
there is a shuttle to the gondola as well
the zoo opens from 8am to 5pm
we were there from 11-5pm and we finished all the exhibits (almost) at a tiring pace so i would recommend any one who can spend one day there to start from 8am at a leisurely pace



the taipei zoo is at the end of one of the mrt lines and was easy to reach
the line is elevated so you get to see some of the taipei area and while you are getting there
the zoo has the usual variety of animals and also has reptile and bird exhibits
as is the case with most zoos, some of the animals could not be seen because the enclosures provide them areas that are hidden from view
a few of the exhibits were being renovated and were not open
the giant panda exhibit was closed the day i visited, but i don't know how common that would be
the terrain around the zoo is quite hilly and it is a fairly strenuous walk to the farthest area of the zoo
there is a shuttle train the goes up to near the thighest part of the zoo, and i would recommend taking it up and walking back down ($5 taiwan or about $0
16 us for the train)
the flowers and other plants were the equal or better than the animal exhibits and many are identified
the orchids were particularly beautiful, and i thought that the zoo plants were as good or better than the botanical gardens



this is the first zoo i've seen or heard of with a mcdonalds and a 7-11 in the park grounds
it cost equivalent to $2 usd to enter this well planned attraction
all the animals are basically housed according to geographical location around the world
there are lots of toilets available and the grounds appear to be wheelchair friendly
a very small fee is charged for the train shuttle around the park and the bus shuttle to the maokong gondola
access to the zoo is extremely easy on the taipei metro, with a station at the door
park maps printed in english are available upon request
overall it is a clean, cheap (but not nasty) enjoyable day out
even if you forget your hat there are stalls at the gate selling the much needed protection



the entrance fee was cheap and i would recommend this place if you are traveling as a family
though i only saw 1 panda, which i expected to see several of them in the zoo
i was lucky to see the panda eat some bamboo leaves and i really enjoyed watching the panda


i think your kids will enjoy this view too





our kids like the penguins in particular
bathrooms in a lot of places and vending machine with reasonably priced drinks
the only drawback is the absence of a bigger map
i don't know if we just didnt know where to get
not having a big readable map slowed us down a bit, but we didn't get lost, it is easy to find your way around



conveniently close to the maokong gondolas the zoo is a cheap side visit
a well thought out design, with convenient facilities, the first i've been to with a 7-eleven and mc donalds inside, and the highlight being the easy accessibility to see the pandas, at other zoos you have to pay extra and line up for hours



we had a great afternoon at the zoo
it was good to see they had sectioned the animals into areas of the world, as we didn't really need to see the australian animals
it was fantastic to see one of the pandas
they were inside due to the heat which made it difficult to get to close but it was beautiful watching it eat bamboo
the zoo is massive and in 3 hours we didn't have time to see everything we wanted to so allow plenty of time



the taipei zoo is very well thought out
it's spread out on a sloping hill where you can ride a little train to the top ($5 nt), then just take your time walking down through the zoo
the design of the zoo is excellent
it reminded me a little of animal kingdom in disney world where even walls have art and sculpture built into them
the animal enclosures themselves are very large and well designed simulating their home environments
the zoo is huge
they have all kinds of animals sectioned off into different continent groups
just the snake and reptile building must have had 30 different kinds of snakes (which our son loved!)we brought our 3 year old son and i discovered the zoo to be set up specifically for kids
all the enclosures have very low fences and windows that small children can easily see into
the zoo itself and the train in the zoo are totally free for kids under 6
 there are lots of little passageways and small windows and doors designed for kids
cost wise, the zoo is an incredible bargain
kids under 6 are free
between 6 and around 12 or so, it costs $30 nt
and for adults, it's only $60 nt
where else in the world do you find a bargain like that? even lunch was cheap (for 2 adults and a kid, we paid about $300 nt)
i can definitely see the zoo getting packed on the weekends
we went on a weekday and right when they opened
with the exception of some schools on field trips, we had the place to ourselves
many areas of the zoo are shaded with huge trees and vegetation which keep you out of the son
still, if it's a hot day, i recommend bringing an unbrella as the taipei sun can be brutal
we plan to go back, on ever visit to taipei



entrance fees is cheap n they have a wide variety of animals
we spent a whole day at the zoo
bus rides are also very affordable
best part - panda watching is free! (in singapore, visitors got to pay extra to watch the pandas from afar)


the taipei zoo was one of the more recommended place of interest we saw when planning our family trip there
indeed it was not a disappointment
the trip started with a casual train ride from taipei city, which is surprisingly less than 1/2 an hour travel
we were also surprised at how cheap the entrance is comparing with the singapore zoo
i guess because we have chosen a week day and therefore we are not seeing crowds
the zoo is big while environment is peaceful, it is a great place for a stroll while our kids enjoy learning more about animals
the only thing that i do not really like is the panda exhibit
probably because of the over publicity that it is not so spectacular in reality
i would consider other animals to be more interesting
overall i will give a good rating to this attraction and would recommend for family trip involving grandparents and children
it iis a place suitable for all ages



most of the animals were out and about, but the park is in need of some maintenance
the recycle poop signs cracked us up at every restroom
the day was overcast and cool, so we did not want to do panoramic things, the zoo was a good fit
the bug section is really run down and was one of our first stops, so may have made us look more critically at other sections
easy access via subway



firstly it only cost about aud2 to get in to the zoo
it's easy to find and get to and a great place to spend an hour or two
we really only wanted to see the pandas so went there first before spending an hour or two with the other animals
not the best zoo ever but definitely worth it if you have time
we also caught the gondola up to maokong mountain from here
beautiful views



great to see pandas in taiwan as a lot of companies and associations have them as their logos and mascots
also there are king penguins and all sorts of animals from every continent
the entrance fee is super cheap, over 65 it's free, also accepts student cards
worth to visit and i suggest you use the inside shuttle train because the zoo is huge




this is an enormous zoo, with relaxing gardens and a huge range of animals
my main reason for visiting was the giant pandas, which were fantastic, but we ended up staying most of the day, and saw some interesting animals, some of which i'd never seen before, quite close up
we went early on a monday
the maoking gondola doesn't operate on a monday, unfortunately, but the upside was that the zoo was very uncrowded
at us$2 per person entry, don't miss it
the mrt stop is right next to the zoo



reasonable price with good variety of animals on display!enjoyed it even though we only reach there like around 3pm and overshot the time a little when we leave at 5
10pm





i liked it because it fairly convenient, and can be a half day or full day activity
i've been there twice, but didn't have the chance to visit all the animals, since it is fairly large
i think it's a good place to visit with the family / kids
but during the summer, it can get a bit hot! bring your hat and sun tan



this is the largest zoo in asia and is a wonderful place to spend the day
at only 30nt as an entrance fee it is great value for money
because of the large size of this zoo there is a train which (for a small fee) can take passengers to the back of the zoo so they may walk through the different sections on the way back to the entrance
the zoo is divided into different climatic sections making it easy to navigate and the zoo has a wide variety of well kept animals
it takes a full day to see all of the animals
i recommend going to the zoo in the spring and fall because the weather in the summer may be a little hot to make it an enjoyable experience



clean place to go with small kids
and it's nice to take the cable from there to the highest peak of taipei



largest zoo in asia
very well-maintained and healthy animals
love the gift shops
came for the pandas and the koalas
catch the feeding times for better appreciation



we had a great time in the zoo, lots of various animals you can see not in the cage
the place was soooo huge you can not finish it half day you have to be there at least whole day to enjoy everything



the entrance fee is so affordable and if you have children with you they were love this visit
the zoo is not far from taipei
it is big and you get to see the giant panda and many animals from different part of the world
there is also a bird park and a very educational section of the amphibian and reptile house
the penguins and the bears are great attraction too
you can use the train shuttle to go to the other part if you need to skip certain part of the zoo
you basically need at least a full day to really get to see everything
my family really enjoy the time there



very crowded but at least it's a big area
you can visit while waiting for your glass cabin maokong gondola
finding food around here can be a nightmare due to the crowd, bring your own food if you can
not many shelters in the compound, bring an umbrella
the entrance ticket is real cheap though



although the kids enjoyed it nonetheless
near the zoo was the maokong gondola which we truly enjoyed
the views for the 15 minute ride or so were spectacular
try riding the crystal cabin even for only one way to catch a better glimpse of the lower part of the mountain/hill



one of the tourist spot u should'nt miss while visiting taiwan, its just few minutes outside taipei city,and u feel like you're in the middle of the forest right away, for a mere 2 us dollar entrance fee, a whole day of excitement awaits u
its a very big and complete zoo, with koalas, penguin and pandas as their main attraction
i'd been to chengdu city in china, where panda's are abundant, but honestly the panda's in taipei zoo were more fun to see, the panda' s in taipei are so energetic, hes playing all the time with his toys,he never cease to amaze the crowd
it consists of petting area, nocturnal animals, asian animals, african wild life, aviary and so on
and maokong gondola is just nearby, if you're finish with the zoo, u can take the gondola ride to maokong, enjoy the nite city view of taipei while sipping your tea or coffee



a very large zoo, full of animals, panda, koala bears, kangaroo etc
no annoying tourist groups there
half day is just enough with very fast pace moving, just imagine how big is it
admission is inexpensive
a must visit!


families love to spend sundays at the zoo with their children
zoo is easy to get to, as it is the last stop along the 'brown' metro line in taipei
zoo is well laid out, with many different areas of displays
pens are spacious for the animals too, which is a good for them
can take pictures of your kids next to models of animals, like panda bears and hippos
visit the gift shop first, rather than last, because they kick everyone out at 5 pm and if you are at the top of the hill, it's a long way down to gift store which will be closed by then
gift store is worth a look and is very affordable
bring an umbrella if it appears cloudy - it spat rain all day while i was there and i wished i had one to avoid getting wet
start early if you can, to see everything there before closing time, as there is a lot to see



taipei zoo attracted because of the giant pandas but alas, they needed their privacy for procreation purposes
for me, this zoo was still special because it had displays seldom seen like the american bison, bobcat, lynx and red panda




was planning to just drop by this place on our way to take the maokong gondola, never to realize that this zoo is huge!we reached at about 3pm, only to explore a quarter of the zoo before it closes at about 5
30pm!if you want to explore thoroughly, please come early!


it's cheap, fun & panda!!! make sure you are ready for a nice long walk as the zoo is located up in the hill and it is huge!


easy to get there, the mrt system is cheap, safe, fast, and clean
admission was cheap
the animals were healthy and live in spacious naturalistic enclosures
the staff were friendly
go early to beat the crowd
if i have time i will go back before i leave taiwan



the zoo is humongous! they have a huge variety of animals
for only nt60 (normal fare) it's a must-see for animal lovers and children



we used to spend a lot of time at the old zoo, that was about 50 years ago so i do mean old
the new zoo is excellent and deserves more than the half day we spent there
we went during the day so i expect it was not as crowded as weekends
however, there were still a lot of school kids attending
the small children as fun to watch with there identical uniforms, holding hands
lots of animals and a place the relax and take your time to view
it appears they are making continual improvements
also would say the panda exhibit is much better than what we've seen in the beijing zoo



i saw the panda! there's this train ride you can take that brings you to a certain point
can't remember the price but it was real cheap! love the macdonalds there too!


natural setting, large and well-attended zoo, easy to reach by subway, animals seemed content and well-treated



went in winter and most of the animals were sleeping? not sure what to see on a full fledged summer but yeah, try to avoid winter
but do proceed to mao kong above the zoo since you're at the far end of taipei already



easy walking, but lots of people
orchids growing on the trees are a site not to miss- look for them! not a lot of animals- but out in the open with foliage and away from city life
it is right at the last stop on the brown line mrt
you can board the gondola from there or if you walk 5 minutes right you can get the gondola from the bottom



i've been in the zoo for a whole day
the zoo is big and the animals are well treated
in addition, the verity of the animals was very big (i've never seen a clouded leopard before)
what impressed me the most, was the size of the animals compounds
finding your way in the zoo was very easy and there was a place to stop and rest or eat everywhere
the zoo is located very close to the mtr station which made it very easy to reach there
generally speaking, it's a nice day or half day trip specially if you combine it with a trip to maokong mountain



taipei muzha zoo is one of the best zoo i have ever visited
it is the largest zoo in asia with lots of animals in different areas such as : tropical rainforest area, african animals area, desert animals area,etc
it took us five hours to explore the zoo as we can walk, take picture and observe the animals as well
it is located at the surburb area of taipei, however it is easy to reach by mrt
the entrance fee is very reasonable,and the souvenir shop is quite reasonable also for the zoo standard
it is an eco friendly place for a family vacation as it has many trees
giant pandas,koalas and penguins are the must-to-see animals
the penguin house is a quite far from the entrance,however we can take a zoo train which can take us back from the penguin house to the entrance gate
there are restaurant and cafes inside the zoo
tips: there is a gondola station near the muzha zoo mrt
you can take gondolas to the maokong mountain area to have a cup of local tea on the cafes up there
very recomended in winter
when the zoo closes, you still can continue your evening in a cold maokong mountain area :)


nice cool weather when i went in december 2012
 initially was there to see the giant pandas and enjoy the park
was surprised to find many endangered animals, namely gorilla, mongolian horses, bison and african elephant, just to name a few that i can remember
overall worth the visit



small but nice zoo
the panda enclosure is the highlight and something the kids loved
very well connected and easy to reach by mrt



very interesting and well maintained
if u are in taipei pls dont forget to visit the zoo
its a must!


most of the enclosure had only an animal making it looks lonely, but the entry ticket to the place is cheap only nt60


the zoo is large, which is always a bonus for the affordable entry price
plenty of animals in spacious enclosure and ample space for tourists to move about and view the animals from different angles
the amenities were also suitably located and reasonably priced


cheap entrance fee and you get to see tonnes of animals
the zoo is really huge and you don't have to pay extra money to see the pandas or even the koala
good for family



not what i expected
very hot
have to walk very far to get to places
the only resto is mcdonalds and is very full of people
a tip is upon entrance to the zoo, you have to ride their tram service to go up to the penguin area then walk going back
if you do it like what we did, you have to walk uphill most of the time, so tiring



is very cheap with the entrance ticket nt60 for so many animals you can visit
e
g
panda, koala, penguin, brown bear, bird park, many hippo, wolf, big gorilla, tropical / africa animals & etc
the zoo is well maintained & when we visit they are doing the upgrading works



ample of space and animal variety
a breeze to browse around with the self guided map and helpful staff
tram is available as the zoo is very large



the mrt ride to the zoo was quite tolerable
and the animals in the zoo seem quite happy and content :)


they had a wide range of animals to see & the line for the pandas are not as long anymore
theyre absolutely adorable! must go see them if you never seen one in person
i went over the summer, and the heat was unbearable but luckily they do have a lot of indoor exhibition
i would recommend bringing your own lunch, i don't remember seeing much food stands or restaurants around
i agree that some animals did not look so happy due to their space, but what can i say? taiwan is a small island





it felt like a taking a hike in the moutain
animals there seems relaxed, and health
the panda was so cute! waste basket everywhere, so you would not see garbage
recommend to take the "train bus" to the top, and walk down
the station is right before the panda stadium



this zoo has a wide variety of animals
we were impressed with how close we could get to giraffes, rhinoceros, bears



it wasn't overly crowded at all and it was easy to get to on the metro
a world class zoo, worth a visit if you're in taipei



we had great time visiting the park
my wife cannot believe the ticket prices they charge - us$2 per person
we walked to the "back hill" area and had great time just jogging paths
having visited 4 ohter panda exhibites in the world, the taipei one is the best one i have seem


went here this sunday
my lord, kids, kids everywhere
in positive tone of course, because it shows that taiwan definitely has smaller ageing population threat than china or japan, it also helps that the kids are cute
that being said, a sunday visit is definitely not an option if you dislike kids around (how could you?), maybe try another day so long as it's not monday (because on different mondays, different exhibits are closed)
agreeing with the prior suggestions, you should definitely walk this zoo downward to save your energy
this place is huge
so after the must-visit to panda and koala house, take the shuttle tram for nt5, and walk your way downward



if you haven't seen panda, then is the place to go
also this zoo is very nice otherwise too
it is best to go here the same day you take gondola
but it is a long day then





we visited on 30/12/2012
a big thank you to the personal especially the lady at the dinosaur exhibit and the young gentleman at the schuttle station (bird station) for your help and friendly information
its was a day to remember


2 pandas were at the zoo
there was a small line up
we did not check out other animals just pandas--that was worth the admission fee--main purpose of the trip to taipei



one of the nicest and best managed zoos in asia
very educational and easy to visit (close by the taipei zoo mtr station)
very affordable too



seems like december is a very good time for tourists to go to taipei in general as i hear the lines for pandas can get quite long
there was no line when i went
i don't think this zoo is so big, but i am comparing it to places like the chiang mai zoo which has about the same amount og exhibits but spread out over a huge area
taipei zoo is not like this and i found it easy to move through the zoo within 3 hours or so
i skipped the birds section but saw the rest of the zoo inthat time without the use of any shuttles
with kids, the situation may be different but for us, it was not a problem at all
there are copious vending machines and convenience stores as well as a mcdonald's so you can eat and drink very cheaply or at least as well as in the rest of the city
not too many options for meals, though



the zoo is so big
lucky we visited in december 2012, the weather was cooling cold, so its easy to walk the distance
but the zoo size is really huge, couldn't covered the whole park even with 3 hours spent there
every animal's pens are large, so tourist have space to view the animals and takes pics
toilets and drinks dispenser machine can found at every few corner
we rents light baby stroller for our 4 year old son ( who refused to walk much ) for only nt50, some deposits ( refundable ) are required
do rents the stroller if you didn't bring yours
as the zoo is really huge
it should takes more than half a day if you wishes to covers the whole zoo sightseing



this zoo was one of the nicer ones i have seen in asia
the displays are adequately plentiful and well presented
the animals seem well cared for
the display descriptions could be a little more educational but otherwise it is a nice family experience



we took the maokong gondola to the taipei zoo, and the view was great! of course, the more convenient way would be to take wenshan-neihu line (brown line]) until the very end until the taipei zoo
very easy! there are shuttle buses provided within the park if you'd like to have quick access to the different sections of the zoo
they have a great variety of animals
i quite enjoyed the penguin exhibit, as well as the adorable koalas! lastly, my favourite were the two pandas, tuan tuan and yuan yuan
such cutiebears!!! very playful and entertaining
make sure you arrive at the zoo early, as it does close at 5:00pm i believe
entrance fee for adults were nt$60! definitely recommend spending a day at the taipei zoo
lots to see and do!!


great big zoo
the zoo needs a bit of upkeep and ugrading

fencing etc, a little worn out
but they have many types of animals


but what we loved most were the pandas



loved the zoo
so many animals to see and it's extremely big
most of the animals have a lot of area so that they can roam freely
it was raining and was still a great part of the trip
if you love animals this is a must
there's two mcdonalds in the area for food
one is in the zoo and the other is at the beginning of the gondola



entrance fee is very affordable, but not much attractions to be seen
although the pandas are quite likeable



for the cheap entry fee, this is considered to be a very decent zoo
the area is huge!we started around 11am after a meal at madonald and left the zoo around 5pm as the sky turned dark
lots of marts (7-eleven type) in the zoo which made it easy to get snacks for kids
i took the advice on tripadvisor/zoo information counter - so we took the nt5 tram ride near the macdonald (from the entrance to the next stop)
so our walk was down slope rather than up-slope
the zoo has many animals but not that many of each animal
so the animals habitats can be quite bare


example 1 or 2 goats, 3 horses, 1 brown bear, 3 wild cats etc this is worth a visit even if you just want to see the panda
cute panda was very active when we got there!


must go , unless you dislike animals ! pandas , koalas are just lovely and we were lucky to see both were awakened 



very nice zoo and well maintain
it was located in the midst of the mountain
it was cheap and with very good facilities



i'm a huge zoo lover, so this review may be slightly biased, but i really enjoyed the taipei zoo
it is pretty huge, and i was daunted by some reviews that said it was not quite walkable, but for ntd60 i was more than willing to give it a shot
i spent nearly the whole day (11am - 5pm) leisurely walking the entire zoo and covered every area but the insectarium and the waterfowl observatory, neither of which i had intended to see, so it was definitely doable for me
although the variety of animals isn't the greatest relative to the land area, the taipei zoo makes up for it in quantity - there were countless giraffes and zebras, and several bears and penguins, which was a real treat
it's a little bit old, but understandable for the entrance fee
i went on a weekday and while it wasn't empty, it was very pleasant to walk around and there were no lines to see any of the animals, not even the pandas (which were up and walking about and eating bamboo shoots the entire time)
also, there are several scenic rest stops, bathrooms, water coolers, and cheap and delicious food stalls populating the zoo, which was fabulous
my personal favourite was the bakery beside the camel enclosure
their pastry was a real treat!


walked to almost the whole zoo
was interesting

main highlights for me was the pandas, mating n honking turtles n the barking squirrel lmao



thoroughly enjoyed the zoo! the animal habitats are very natural and the variety of animals are numerous
we didn't get through the entire attraction, starting after just having lunch at the mcdonalds there
compares to the singapore zoo, which we love!


it was only $60 nt ($2us)
we went a tuesday and it was very empty
no lines to see the pandas
there was one outside and one inside right next to the glass( less than 5 ft away)
love insect house lots butterfly flying around you
huge zoo with lots to see



it was so cheap 
tw 60 for adult and tw30 for child and it was right next to the taipei zoo station
dont forget to see the pandas but dont go when it is november as many of the animals were inactive
it is a lovely zoo to visit as the layout is suitable for strolling as pedestrian and vehicles have different lanes
it is a people zoo not targetted at the tourist market
would definitely go again



the entry fees are cheap but please do not waste time
big but nothing much to see
the koalas and pandas look pathetic



very good for kids to get educated
very informative for some parts but it closes early and its a little far



the pandas are amazing! you have to see them
incredibly cheap entry fee
great displays, lovely location
they need more toilets and food outlets as its a busy place



we went there on the first day of our trip and were too tired to walk the whole zoo
overall the zoo was big and have interesting animals such as panda and koala
as the zoo is mainly for local the things are cheap and we could get alot of souviners unlike other zoos
however the train ride should cover more part of the zoo so that it wouldnt be too tiring to explore the whole zoo



apparently the largest zoo in all of south east asia
there definitely is a lot to see and ground to cover while here
you can easily spend the day
i spent about 4 hours but pushed myself to rush through most of it due to time constraints
i went on a monday morning and the attendance seemed very low
there were entire exhibits whereas i was the only guest there for 10 minutes at a time
it's easy to get to since it is at the end of one of the subway lines
there's a mcdonald's, 7-11, as well as other food places inside of the property itself
the zoo is certainly showing its age with many/most of its exhibits
to me, it felt like it was constructed in the early 80's
despite this though, this zoo offers one of the best values when it comes to tourist attractions in taipei
ticket prices are basically $2 per adult - a major bargain! tips: be sure to realize some of the major exhibits close on certain days of the month
look into it before hand so you are no disappointed you can't see the panda bears, etc
stop by the main office, located next to 7-11, when you first get there to pick up an english map of the zoo



of course the star attraction is the pandas and luckily at 10am on an overcast monday morning it was relatively quiet (no queueing to get into the panda house) by lunchtime the place was getting a bit busier
after taking your pictures of the pandas there's a gift shop next door offering a mind-boggling selection of panda-themed souvenirs
once you've loaded up with panda cookies, pens, pencils, notebooks, fluffy pandas, playing cards, mugs etc
etc
you can go off and enjoy the rest of the zoo!there's a lot of animals to see but the place is really spread out - it was fine for me on a cool, cloudy morning but it would probably be a bit of a slog to get around everything in the heat of the summer (there is a miniature train to get round some parts) the entrance fee is very cheap - i paid just 60$ using my easypass travel card
i wanted to do the gondola too but it was closed for the day for maintenance work



this zoo is large and there is a lot of walking
probably a good 5-6 miles in hilly terrain
the zoo is very well laid out, the animals have very nice habitats, it's clean, the people are all very friendly
i took over 300 photos! its a fun day (allow a full day and take it a bit more leisurely than we did)
do the gondola ride nearby as well
totally worth it!


great collection of animals, including pandas, koalas and penguins
i believe it is the largest zoo in asia



my purpose of going to the zoo was to see the pandas! admission fee plus mini train and shuttle is 65nt
the pandas was eating bamboo and playing when we saw them
they are adorable



the zoo is so prepare to walk or at least take note of the schedule of the train
zoo is quite old already


go there specially to see pandan must go early morning to catch the active pandan bf they sleep zzzzzz


this is not an essential place to visit if you only have a limited time in taipei
however, if you have spare time and you want to see the giant pandas it's a well laid out zoo with nicely planned enclosures
the animals looked healthy and happy
aside from the pandas, there's a good selection of formosan animals and others from around the world
be prepared to queue to see the pandas - and for the noise from the bus loads of kids (but then i guess it is a zoo!)
compared with other zoos i have been to around the world, this is also the cheapest (nt60)



tuan tuan yuan yuan are adorable
but patience is required sometimes to get them in your camera's view



nice big zoo with lots of space for the kids to run around in
i went specifically to see the pandas although i have to admit i was really disappointed with it
it was smallish concrete room with a painted outdoor scene on the back wall
otherwise, it was nice to see all the other animals in open enclosures (instead of cages) in this nice big zoo



i like zoos, when they are well done and aid conservation and education


of all the zoo's i've been to this was the most enjoyable in asia
it's huge and takes a day or 2 to explore properly



i loved my trip to the zoo here in taipei
i went with my partner and although we are 'young at heart' are perhaps above the main target audience for the zoo but we had an excellent time
all the informational signs were bilingual
in both written english and mandarin
even the speaker announcements were also in both languages
i feel the zoo has made a huge effort to be foreigner friendly which made it such a great experience for us, as well as it being super child friendly also, it is a great place for families to go!we had some advice from some taipei locals not to go in the full taiwan heat of summer because a lot of the animals are hiding in the shade to stay cool in the heat
we are glad we waited to go in october
it was a glorious sunny day but not too hot for the animals (or us - approx 27c as opposed to 30+c+), so a lot of the animals were out in full view sunbathing or playing
they has such a huge range of animals which exceeded our expectations, making this activity a day-filler for sure
i loved every enclosure, the formosan section was particularly interesting to see what animals are native here
my least favourite were the elephants and rhinos
i feel that their enclosures are too small and that they are probably not stimulated and taken care of as much as necessary
the elephants were just standing by their gate rocking and the rhinos were huddled in a group not moving, looking glazed over and it kinda upset me
i also wondered why all the larger animals are kept seperate? the gorillas for example
they looked like they had enough space individually but compared to other zoos, for example the dutch 'apenheul' - where all the gorillas are in an enclosure together and they have feeding times allows the kids to see their group behaviour, who is head of their groups etc - they are separated, which i found a little strange
the food was also good and reasonably priced
the whole day was a bargain day out, where we overall really enjoyed ourselves
i would definitely recommend this for everybody, not only kids and families



token admission fee for a well-run zoo; lots of water stop and clean washrooms
eateries inside have fair quality and price



i loved the open air concept of this zoo, which avoided traditional cages all together when possible
i felt like i was in the jungle since the design of the zoo revolves so much around the beautiful landscape of taiwan
i loved all of the animals, the pandas were especially cool and played peek-a-boo with us! the koalas were also very cool! it was a very special experience when we got to see the giraffes running around an open grassy space with the mountains in the background
this is truly a beautiful zoo! we are going back next year when we return to taiwan



great place to check out with friends or family
was most excited to check out their panda and koala exhibits
make sure to come early or on a weekday to avoid the huge weekend crowds, and bring a brimmed hat and sunblock if you're visiting in the summer or spring



very spread out so must be prepared for a lot of walking but


it's only 1
50 usd and on a weekday completely empty so i think it's worth it
plus the gondola is only 5 minutes away and both combined make for a great half day trip
to get to the zoo on the subway system from main station, it will take you 1 transfer and 30 minutes for only 1
50usd in fare



my kids spent an entire day there
cheap entrance fees - plenty to see, recommend to spend ntwd5 to take a train all the way to see the penguins and walk



it's a quite good zoo with many animals statues that you can take a picture with
the pandas area and pandas themself are very clean compared to chengdu which has more natural space and much more pandas! it's was nice to see koalas too
the entry is cheap and it worth it
many trees inside good to walk close the them



took my small children 3 and 5 to the zoo today, very convenient on the mrt which is family friendly and easy to use
there are plenty of lifts, clearly marked, for prams, lots of loos and baby changing rooms
london underground take note
we bought an mrt 1 day ticket for 250 td each which included the gondola ride up into the hills, to maokong
great experience, a 4km ride over wooded hills and valleys and lots of tea houses serving great food at the top
we sat on a balcony in the mountain tea house overlooking the valleys and city in the distance
lunch was a set menu for 1000 td
we then made the journey back down via gondala and walked the short distance to the zoo from the gondola station
top tip for the zoo is to take the road train, 5 td, up to the top of the zoo which is laid out on a hill and make your way down, thus avoiding a march up the hill, which would be too much for little legs
the road train has space for buggies, my son was asleep and i was able to just carry the buggy and boy into the buggy space at the back of the carriage and sit right next to him during the 5 minute ride up the hill
the zoo was a bargain entrance price, 60 td, there's plenty of space inside, for humans at least, and lots of seats and tables if you need a rest
two ice creams, very good and generous portions, were 120 td
not bad - the entrance price is the same price as an ice cream
i was saddened by the sight of the elephants, both clearly bored senseless, swinging their trunks and stepping from side to side, displaying behaviour that showed they had endured years of captivity in a cramped space
the tiger also walked up and down alongside the window into its enclosure, only occasionally stopping, delighting the crowds banging on the glass, to roar while clawing at the faces peering in
the zoo is renovating some animal enclosures, the hippo house for example
i have to admit that a zoo always makes me feel uncomfortable as i hate to see animals cooped up
smaller children had a problem seeing the animals, despite the small pens, because often there were flower beds along the top of the walls which means you have to lift up anyone under say the age of 8
 from almost all parts of the zoo you have a view of the surrounding hills and often glimpse the gondolas making their way up to maokong
we went home via the mrt which once again was efficient, spacious and easy to navigate



the patrons of the zoo tend to bug the animals and alot of the exhibits are laid out in a manner in which the animals cannot help but be stressed
you cannot keep animals in plain view without offering them a refuge
an amazing amount of animals though and worth the visit



the zoo does not have enough space to accomodate the animal from africa and north america such as bison, elephant, zebro, tigers, antelope and etc
these type of animals requires free realm of large space and they are sufferring and in a miserable living condition
taipei's zoo need to specialize to keep only species who do not requires large living space



nice variety of animals in comfortable habitats
great price, good choice for kids
don't miss the gondola ride at the adjacent venue for great views of the hills surrounding taipei



this is a pretty nice zoo but the remarkable thing is the low admission fee
it's fun to go just for a stroll on a sunday
take food if you don't go at high season because many of the stands are part time



the taipei zoo is an easy attraction to get too and accessible from the taipei zoo mrt station
there are plenty of f&b outlets scattered throughout the zoo, and the toilets were as clean as any toilet in a zoo can be
we took the gondola and alighted at the taipei zoo cable car station, which was about 20-25 min
from the cable car station, it was a shuttle bus into the zoo
i think the fee was about nt$5 per person
it was than another 5-10 minutes drive into the zoo
we were dropped off at the bird section and made our way down to the panda exhibition
the zoo is very big and a must for animal lovers! the entry fee is cheap, and you get a discount if you use the youth travel card
the zoo has shady areas with mist sprays to help keep the temperature down during the hot summer
check out my blog for more photos



it was big and spacious, however, i needed a ride




it was tough on my two kids aged 11 and 4 years old
they needed rides , too




we were hoping that they would have a golf cart for rent or something, even with a hired tourist guide or a hired driver to drive us around
the roads are wide enough for carts to move around, one way if they must , so it will be orderly







we would gladly pay for the extra cost




needless to say, the zoo was so big and spacious , we were all so bone-tired and sweaty after we finished touring the park
the animals are all worth it, but it would have been really great if we could enjoy the animals from a moving vehicle safe from the hot midday sun on summertime
(may 2010)


nice to visit this zoo on weekends and bring along the kids
and oh, you can visit this place any season
when i went there it was still winter, so a little chilly but i still enjoy seeing nice the beautiful, some huge and monster animals
i enjoyed my the sassy and bubbly penguins, and the strong and stubborn horses that gallop carelessly
the orangutan with their giant built body amazes me
the king - lion was so fierce and beautiful
hah! when i visit this place i brought along my family and friends with kids
kids were amazed of penguins and birds and fishes
would definitely come back here again
hope soon



very easy to get to (by mrt)we went in summer and it was very hot
though there are some shady parts with mist, the rest was hot hot hot! bring an umbrella
many different animals over quite a large area
my kids enjoyed the nocturnal animals exhibit
you can also ride the tram for nt$5
good for tired little feet
all in all it was an enjoyable day for the children and was really of good value
we did not manage to finish exploring the whole place
kids were tired, so we rode the tram to the cable car shuttle pick up point and sat in the cable car up to maokong
a good day i would say
bring a snack, hat and lots of water if you're there in summer



the layout of the zoo was nice and shady for a hot summer day
there are misters around which helped a bit with the heat
i arrived a bit late so i couldn't see the whole zoo but was able to see the pandas (first time seeing in person!) which were fun
luckily the line wasn't that long and the workers kept the people moving through so everyone has a chance to see them
at closing time, was able to see the zoo keepers visit the elephants (who seemed to be dancing, just swaying back and forth together)
the zoo keepers managed to get the two elephants on their hind knees to wash their back feet without using any force
this was probably the highlight of my visit!convenietly located right outside the subway station, i was able to pay for zoo entrance (nt$60) using transit card
the day that i went there was a special, buy one, get one free



it has almost all the animals that you would see in a regular zoo
i like the fact that the zoo has a shuttle bus, so it doesn't take long to walk
i also love the souvenir that the zoo has
if you are going to taipei and have kids, then you must go to this place
another recommendation for going to this zoo is don't go on a hot sunny day



i did'nt expect much, but went away impressed
glad to have visited!!firstly, the entrance fee was really cheap compared to other zoos
additionally, there was a promo, so i just paid nt60 for 2 tickets!!the zoo area is huge, plenty of shaded area to hide from the blazing sun
some animals are smelly (very normal) but they all appear healthy
panda exhiibit is very popular currently
plenty of food & drink outlets at reasonable price
toilets are clean,well located & plenty too
the zoo is just next to the maokong cablecar, so it would be good to plan a whole day visiting the zoo followed by the cablecar up the highland in the late afternoon
after visiting the zoo, go up the highland to spend the late afternoon & evening up there to enjoy the cool breeze & night city view



the zoo is huge! and really nice, too bad that part of the birds area was under construction when i went there
if you walk slowly and stop to see every animal there, it will take you easilly 3 whole hours
and if you do, don't forget to take the map at the entrance, and the paper where you can stamp all the areas name on it
(you can find stamps all around the zoo, i don't remember exactly where, i was disapointed i didn't get the paper :/ ), i think you can win something doing it too
or maybe it's just for a souvenir
i really liked the insects area, where you could walk in a room filled of butterflies flying around you (i hope you are not afraid of them though ahah)
don't worry, the room is really big, and they have many other places to land than on your head
anyway, i got a lot of fun there + the fact the weather was good the day i went there
not too hot, but not heavy rain, just a bit that made the animals going out
tips: you can use the easy card to pay the entrance fee (nice discount if you got the student easy card, not sure with the normal one)


they had a good selection of animals from all over the world
it is a pleasant few hours, and off course the pandas attract the crowds
not bad, but there were a few local species you cannot see anywhere else, but it is expected in a country island as taiwan



i visited to zoo with my husband and 5 year old son a few weeks ago
the zoo is very cheap and so in that respect is great value for money
it is very large and spread out so make sure you are ready for a fair bit of walking
there are lots of animals to see - including the pandas - and they are separated into areas of the world
there are a few animals that are repeated though but not a major issue
it is a good zoo for the spectrum of animals and information available and although we really enjoyed our time there - it is not as good as singapore zoo in my opinion but if you are in taipei i would check it out as it is definitely one of the better zoos around the world



there were some highlights at the zoo (the apes and monkey come to mind) but the pandas and the elephants seemed to me to woefully situated
the elephants were sharing space with the hippos and didn't have anywhere near enough space themselves and the panda area was spartan and clinical



set in lush tropical settings, very easy to spend a whole day, such great value, a train ride will take you to the far end at an extra cost nt$5 each way(less than 20c au$) then walk back if your an aussie you can see the koalas for a bit of home feel, amazing reptile area, i had no idea the huge number of different turtles/tortoise there are, inside the gates there is 7-11, mcdonald's and a medical center, variety of souvenir shops spread throughout the zoo, best to go early morning as it usually rains in the mountains every afternoon and gets really hot afterwards, the animal exhibits are nicely kept and surrounding grounds are beautiful, the flora is just as amazing, the entrance fee is nt$60 (au$2) but the day i went it was half price if you paid for 2 adults
from taipei its about 45 - 60 minutes on the mrt have to change trains twice, if you have time the maekong gondola is also worth a visit



taipei zoo is best zoo that i ever been
it is clean with lots of interesting point
of course no doubt, panda is the most attractive spot!my suggestion here is if you go there better take the train go up the hill (the end) and start from there then walk down to the entrance
you will enjoy better :)


the zoo had a good selection of healthy animals in enclosures that get you as close as possible to the animals
my family didn't see any animal shows or feedings to know how those were, but just seeing the animals was thrilling
we have been to many zoos, and this one was quite large and well kept
our only problem was that it was brutally hot and sticking to the shade only adds humidity to the mix
we also struggled to find anyone to speak english when we had questions



took my 11yr son, what a great experience
great value for money
spent almost a full day at the zoo, was well worth it
will definately go again



right before we flew to taiwan, we happen to visit the local zoo in oakland, california
it cost usd$28 for the two of us
though we were already zoo'ed out by then, we decided to visit the taipei zoo, and boy were we glad we did! the taipei zoo was huge and a lot of fun for us to walk around and just enjoy a leisure day
overall, we probably spent about four hours to cover most of the zoo
the grounds were meticulously maintained, and the animal habitats looked comfortable and large
we saw plenty of animals we don't get at the zoos back home, with the pandas and koalas being a highlight
and all this for usd$2 per person!we went on a weekday so that it wouldn't be too crowded - we read this is key
one big regret was not being able to take the maokong gondola ride, since they were closed for maintenance
this zoo ranks amongst the top of all the zoos we have ever been to
it's been a long time since i've been to the san francisco zoo, but the taipei zoo definitely rivals that, and at a fraction of the cost! must visit -- this is also a great place for families with young children
plenty of eateries around if you need a break from all the walking



loved the panda and all the animals in there
it could be very humid in the summer
so be prepared
it's easy to get to by taking the muzha line to the end
after the zoo, one can also take the maokong gondola
great place for family outing



very nice and enriching place, there are alot of animals, however maybe due to the hot season, animals were not very active
didnt get to see the panda front face as it was sleeping with butt facing the display area



great place for the kids! panda, penguin, lion, tiger - all you can imagine is there! very affordable admission:) bring yourself a good pair of tennis shoe and fluid for hydration!


setting is modern, clean and well maintained
there is shuttle train that is great for an overview
best part was the panda building
on a hot day, it was nice to enter the quiet, air conditioned comfort of the panda exhibit
there were 2 pandas, slowly walking around the separate enclosure
they would doze periodically, then meander around in a set pattern
the setting was bare concrete, with some pot planted shrubs, so could be improved to be more "natural"


i went to the zoo with very low expectations of what i would find
the zoo in my hometown is really expensive but small
however, i was pleasantly surprised by the taipei zoo
for just a few dollars (usd), you get to explore a huge zoo (huge to me) with many parts and many different kinds of organisms
one of the places worth visiting is the butterfly park
it is an enclosed but relatively open space where butterflies are free to fly around
a very beautiful sight
of course, you should also visit the giant pandas - one of the biggest draws for visitors
i highly recommend taking the maokong gondola down the maokong mountain back from the zoo (where the zoo is)
it is extremely, extremely scenic (many photo opportunities) and it stops on the mountain where you can take a subway back to the city centre



visitors come primarily for the giant pandas
when they are awake, it is nice to be able to view them at play
it is however a disappointment to see them housed in a dreary place
it seems that there is going to be a better and bigger enclosure for them in time to come
entrance fee is dirt-cheap
note the walk is long between enclosures
do try and enter the zoo from the south-east entrance since this would mean a downhill walk rather than an uphill one when entering from the front



you get a true experience in the "jungle"
the exhibits are wonderful
be prepared to walk
you can access the cable car from the high side of the zoo
get a stamp on your hand before you take the bus so you can reenter the zoo
the cost for the zoo was an incredible $2 usd
cant beat that!


a very big place where animals around the world can be seen here from panda to bear, penguins, koala, deer, monkeys, reptiles,and birds
my kids love it

especially the penguins and the panda
even it is raining, we continue to go around the place
they even have a train service to move you around the zoo
there is mcdonalds inside the zoo


at twd 60 entrance fee, we did not have high expectations
however, we were pleasantly surprised as the quality of the exhibits is comparable to major zoos around the world
they even had a pair of rare pandas!


easily accessible via metro but sometimes overcrowded
bring an umbrella during summers because the sun will take a toll on you if you stay under for too long
they have an indoor building were there are many butterflies you can touch them if you are gently enough not to scare them off
great for taking close up pics
the panda section although great is too short they will usher you on for there is a time limit on how long you can stay inside the panda section
eating will also be a problem inside the zoo
the mcdonald is always crowded even after lunch time
there is a small restaurant outside the zoo just close to the exit of the metro of the zoo were they serve good food for a reasonable price
tip: go in the morning so that you can finish in the mid-afternoon then take the gondola, its walking distance from the zoo
its a great way of finishing the day



10 years ago the zoo's animals were sickly
but they have improved and improved and it's a very nice zoo now



if you are traveling, i'd say skip this place
it's not worth while unless you are a residence with children!


took our whole bunch to the zoo and we were so pleased! wide variety of animals laid out in their natural setting
followed others advice (thanks!) to take the tram to the back of the zoo so that we'd be walking downhill the whole way (vs uphill)
took most of the day to see it all and it was well worth it! highly recommend this to one and all! be sure you see/hear the 'honking monkeys'! highlight of the zoo!


took mrt from city to the zoo
tip: use easy card to pay for tickets to skip queue at entrance
the shuttle tram brings you around the place to save you some walking if you are there in summer but do note you have to pay each stretch of the ride although it is highly affordable
visit the panda and koala enclosures at least :)


as the cheapest zoo i have ever been to (student was nt$30 = aud$1), i'm not sure i could expect very much
the giant pandas are the main attraction, with also some elephants, tigers, panthers and other animals
i did feel sorry for the animals being cooped up in their enclosures and didn't enjoy it as much as i would have liked to



great educational place to check out the exotic creatures, lovely natural green surroundings, and entrance fee is only nt$60 (about au$2)
catch the shuttle (looks like a kiddies train) for nt$5 (20c) per ride to save your legs walking uphill to the bird/penquin section
walking downhill is easier



we went there last week and i think it's value for money! only nt$50, you can see so many species of animals closely and also have a great walk up the hill
if you're too tired, you can take the 'little train' cost nt$5 for a ride on the way back to main entrance, it really saves our lifes coz we were exhausted after walking for few hours
butterfly, insects, turtle, lion, elephant, camel, zebra, giraffe, horse, hipo, rhino, penguine, panda



almost most animals you can name can be found here
highly recommend esp for kids and family



not a massive fan of zoo's but really enjoyed taipei, especially as the admission charge at 60twd! panda's were a treat


it is convenient to get to taipei zoo by mrt, just cost you about twd 60
 panda is one of the animal that you can miss out in taipei zoo, other like penguin, koala bear and more
the zoo is very big, i am tired of walking



the zoo was like your average zoo with panda and koala bears attached
it was cleaner than most zoos though and my
oys enjoyed the insectarium
yuck!


it's worth it to go to the zoo in taipei just for the two pandas there
not that they do much, but how many pandas have you seen? bought lots of panda-themed pasalubong for the family back in manila



the zoo only cost $2 us and free for kis under 6, plus the mrt drops you off right there
the zoo is expansive and bring some good walking shoes
on a hot humid day try to make it to the penguin exhibit, as it is the only air condition building



the entrance of the museum is a bit old fashioned, as well as the first buildings, including the one where one can see the pandas
truth is the zoo is beautiful and has some great animals
the pandas are of course a big attraction and your time watching them can be limited but it is worth it
very cheap, some basic fast food available
toilets largely available



taipei zoo is the most famous urban zoo in taiwan with over 400 species calling it home
it's also one of the largest zoos in asia encompassing 165 hectares of land
we entered the taipei zoo via the maokong gondola
the maokong gondola provides a bird's eye view of the area where the zoo is located and a one way trip from the mrt taipei station only costs 30nt
there are two cabin types and we made sure to take a crystal cabin (read: cabins with glass bottoms) for a more interesting ride
the gondola dropped us off at taipei zoo's south entrance
good thing there was a free shuttle service that brought us to the central part of the very huge zoo
there are animals at the taipei zoo but don't expect to see a lot
main attractions though are the penguins, koalas, and the pandas
one thing i appreciated about taipei zoo is that the animals can roam about in its habitat given the zoo's humongous land area
having said that, do expect to walk a mile though to reach certain parts of the zoo so wear comfortable shoes
also, bring an umbrella in case the sun's scorching
for animal lovers, a trip to the taipei zoo is a must
just make sure that you have ample time and the willingness to do a lot of walking to see all the attractions of the zoo

html 



it was good because they have panda and koala so i don't have to make trips to mainland china or australia to see them!!! staff again are very friendly and helpful!!


visited the taipei zoo with my family of 4 plus my 4 yr old grandson, the place is really huge and well maintained, major attractions were the air-conditioned panda cage and the penguins in the ice cage
it is suggested that better start from the top area going down by either taking free ride train or riding the gondola (cable car
only regret was there were some animal/species that are no longer there


my family and i enjoyed our trip here!bigger than singapore zoo


very big !entrance fee is really cheap (adult 60 ntd) - payable via easycard
there are also restaurants inside the zoo which serve good food (as in noodles, chops, rice, etc) - i suggest you go to the restaurants in the african safari area for lunch
lots of clean washrooms, and drinks vending machine everywhere
lots of huts and rest areas too
you definitely need to visit their nocturnal animal exhibit (it;s a building which you can't find in their map)
too bad there's no white tiger
to conserve your energy, i suggest you take the zoo shuttle (you'll see signs upon entering the zoo) which brings you towards the end part of the zoo
then tour your zoo from the end towards the entrance, so that you have a "downhill" tour
wear comfy shoes!there are some parts of the zoos that are evidently old, like the gorilla / monkey areas, etc
these are towards the 2nd half (inner) part of the zoo



it will be better if you visit the zoo with kids
zoo is well set up
if you are tired, can use their train and cost nt 50/person
location is easy to reach by mrt
after finish explore the zoo, you can take mokong gondola nearby
return cost only nt 100
 you pay a bit more if choose glass bottom gondola
zoo and gondola is crowded on weekend
better visit on weekdays



this has to be the most quality and inexpensive zoo in all of asia
at 60 nt$ (about $2 usd), this is a great place to spend half a day, especially after visiting the maokong gondola
my friend and i started at the top and made our way down, which worked out well because this zoo is big
we went on a tuesday afternoon, just as all the student groups were leaving, which left the zoo mostly empty
the animals were very active in the later afternoon, including animals that i hardly ever see active, such as the puma, hippopotamus, and panda
taipei zoo has an exceptional number and diversity of animals (10 hippos, 5 rhinos, and many, many chimps!) the exhibits have good signage in english, although a few parts are only in mandarin
my friend and i were particularly amused by the poo facts which adorn the bathrooms
we walked around for three hours, but still did not have time to see the desert area, formosan animals, or the nocturnal house
i suppose those will have to wait until the next time i can return to taipei!


i wanted to go to the zoo however its too crowded at the entrance hence i did not go in

lol


quite interesting and the kids loved itbut we went there around noon time and a lot of animals were hiding from the sun, so we couldn't see some of them properly


my favorite zoo in asia
well presented, cheap (60 nt$) and a lot of various animals in good health conditions
the monkeys and tigers are 


superb!the nocturnal house is innovative and allow you to discover species that are wildly ignored by day time zooavoid going there on sunday noontime, it can be crowded



we went on a weekday
the zoo was a great treat for us esp as coming from singapore, where the singapore zoo and the night safari has won so many acolades in comparison but our kids enjoy the whole trip
weather played a big part as unlike in singapore, the cool weather allowed us to maximise the entire day without feeling under the heat
the enclosures were not as well done as singapore's but ok
what felt disappointing was the panda enclosure
for the 20 mins that we were there, the sole panda on display sat with its back to us
we know they are shy animals but am sure more can be done or designed for visitors to at least see the face of the panda
there was also a variety of food choices and the retail store was well-stuffed
overall, a fun trip for children on holiday in taipei



what else can you do on a damp saturday morning in taipei? not being a fan of zoos, this was a fill in activity and in hind sight not really worth the effort as it is just another zoo and maybe because of the weather we found it depressing
there is only the one panda on display and to see it pacing in the enclosure did not help
if you must go - it is very easy to get to and the entrance fee was around 2aud



because taipei zoo is large
take the train (a mere 5 nt) to the end of the line and walk (downhill) back toward the entrace
the exhibits are good, the animals seem happy, and the staff are friendly and professional
entrance is cheap, too



spacious walkway for each section
toilet / rest area and convenienve store are evenly distributor in the entire zoo
so you don't have to rush to stock up water or food at the entrance
train ride from inner zoo to the main entrance only cost nt50
which is very reasonable
there's walkway & even special train ride to cater stoller for the little one
so do not hasitate to bring along your stroller
as the little one might get exhausted & need a quick power nap
there's gondola station in zoo which connect you to mao kong
thus, you can plan zoo + mao kong visit in a day



taipei zoo it's very large
it takes at least half a day to visit all the animals
also choose a sunny day
i had the misfortune to go when it rain, but my objective was achieved
i saw the giant panda
i saw him immediately after eating and he was playful and cute
koala and panda house are to the left of the zoo, relatively close to the entrance
also in the left side, inside the zoo, it's a mc 'donaldsin about 2 hours that i've spent at the zoo, i saw a quarter of the animals
so you can imagine how large the zoo is
there are long distances between places with animals
ideal would be to take half a day for zoo and the other half day for maokong gondola, which is very close to the zoo
keyword is 'sunny day'



the taipei zoo was a great, and is easily accessible by train, it is last stop on the brown line
most of the exhibits have english and chinese signs
i highly recommend coming here in the morning (10am or so) on a clear day, and after the zoo take the maokong gondola (directly beside the zoo) all the way to the top of moakong mountain and walking
there are 40+ tea houses, shops, bakeries scattered through out the mountain
on a clear day you will get a beautiful view of taipei
also, if you walk too far like we did and don't want to go all the way back to the gondola you can pick up a bus anywhere on the mountain that will take you back to the zoo, beware though none of the bus signs are in english, but they do go to the zoo



good collection of animals, though with such a modern zoo, would like to see enclosures a bit bigger to keep the animals a little happier
was so hot and humid, only got to see 75%
did take the air trans up the mountains to see smaller villages and temples, amazing
hydrate, and it'll reward you with breath taking views of the city



anyone who had seen taipei zoo says it is best than anything they have seen
such is the natural beauty of the place since everything is arranged here in the natural habitat of the animals
the zoo plays home to lots of animals in the world and this zoo is especially famous for its panda
worth a visit if you are in taipei
this is near to maokong gondola so try to make time to visit that too, when you come there



if you live in taipei and would like to have a cheap, leisurely day out with your family, the taipei zoo is a good choice
but for tourists, especially those on a tight schedule, it is quite a waste of time
barely 20 mins in there, we already felt like leaving
tickets are at nt60 per person and it's free for kids below 6
 the enclosures are spaced very far apart so it's a long walk to see just a few animals
the collection of animals is also quite limited, apart from the rare pandas, which were both back-facing us and sleeping today
the nocturnal animals building was utterly boring
it was a long walk inside the building and the only way to get out was to finish the boring walk
there were owls, and lotsa other tiny animals
was hoping to see something like big, wild cheetahs, but everything was just tiny and boring
the only other zoo, which i remember clearly is the singapore zoo, which is very different, and also far more expensive to visit, which is why i'm not used to a zoo like that
if you have lots of time to spare, like greenery, nature, slow walks, and seeing some animals along the way then this is not bad
but for tourists, this is a big time-waster



some areas are under renovation so we did not get to see some animals
as it was cold, the animals were not too active and the koala just couldn't be bordered with you :(


take the time to go to the zoo while you are in taipei
it truly is world class
it is readily accessible by the metro and admission is free to seniors with proof of age and regardless of nationality



some animals look loopy, pacing back and forth repeatedly like they've gone mad
others just don't even want to move about
the monkeys were the best, always active and therefore entertaining to watch
not worth queuing up for the panda as it only lies down with its back towards you
only if you're lucky, it actually will walk around a bit or eat some bamboo
it is a very cute creature though



my friend and i went to the zoo on saturday, the zoo was very crowed, especially the area with popular animals(pandas,koala


) for ppl who doesn't like animals or have a tight schedule i suggest u can skip this place, but if u are with children or interesting in animals, this is a place u can get something out of it, and try to avoid to go on weekends u may not even get a glimpse on the pandas


although it was cold, it was very good considering the entry fee
many of the areas had a viewing area where those with disabilities or those with little ones in a stroller can view the animals thus making it safer than lifting a child up in order that they may be able to see the animals



though the collection is not very large, a visit at taipei zoo is worth all the time


conveniently located near the mrt, take the brown mrt line and exit at taipei zoo
you can pay the entrance of the zoo with the easy card which is also the mrt card to avoid waiting in line to buy the entrance ticket, the entrance cost ntd 60
- we saw a lot of animals, pandas, koalas, etc


it is well organized, big so make sure to wear good shoes and a lot of fun
inside the zoo, you can take a bus which will take you to the maokong gondola station but make sure to stamp your hand if you plan to return to the zoo later the day



i love the taipei zoo
it is manicured to look like a very natural space, and is one of the best zoos i've ever seen
they don't have two zebras looking forlornly at you through some tall metal fence, they have a herd
if you have a chance to visit, do it!


it's worth it to visit as it only cost nt35 to for the entrance fee
if you have nothing to do, then only visit
not that great! souvenirs can be bought there at nt40



for me, its the best zoo i have ever seen, because its embedded in lush green nature
its big and can be very hot in the summer
cheap entry and very convenient to get there with the mrt (brown line, mucha zoo stop)


very good place to take children, their panda exhibit is great
easy to use the mrt brown line


take it to the end



i've been to zoos around the world, and while this one is nice to walk through, you rarely see many animals
still, i enjoy going


i went during the chinese new year holiday so there were many people there, more so in the afternoon though
the zoo is about a 5 min, or less, walk from the taipei zoo mrt, exit 1
 if you have an easy card there's no need to line up to buy a ticket, just go straight to the entrance and there you can swipe your card, only 60nt
at the entrance they'll also give you a docket (mine was blue) stating the time to enter the panda building
i arrived around 11am and my docket for entering the panda building said 14:50 - 14:59
so i had to plan my sightseeing around this
from the staff they recommended to take the shuttle to the top end of the zoo and walk my way down
you can also catch the gondola from the top part of the zoo (or at the bottom outside the zoo near the mcdonalds
within the zoo there is a mcdonalds on the left hand-side, after going through the entrance, and that was packed when i arrived, so perhaps eat before hand, bring something or go early, there are a few other places to eat at the zoo further up also
i went on the gondola ride, used my easy card also, and at the top is a hifive store (similar to 7/11) and the visitors information - they have a map of the area
during the ride there are 2 or 3 stops where you can choose to hop off or stay on
on the ride you can see the 101 building and view of taipei
within the zoo is a shuttle you can catch up or down the zoo or to the gondola stop
there are separate lines for the shuttle, one to catch up and down the zoo, and one to go to the gondola stop (this line is usually much shorter)
although they call it a shuttle it is much like a train ride on wheels


pics attached
the zoo not only has the usual animals but the different kinds of them also, eg
different types of snakes - boa, python and others, 2 types of rhinos, 3 types of bears - brown bear, panda bear, koala bear, camels, hippos, elephants, american bison, different types of turtles, there's plenty to see
if you're including the godola ride i would think you'd need more than half a day
overall worth a the trip to see



this zoo is pretty nice although quite a distance between each display
there are lots of people there but still plenty of space so people don't quite bump into each other
it's a nice place to bring the kids for a day
there's also the maoking gondola to take after you've been to the zoo



since the gondola and the 101 were covered in rainy clouds we went to the zoo (next to the gondola)
the zoo is like a big park, where you can easily spent half a day! also it seems that there was more than average (in a zoo) attention for education
visit the zoo if you have longer time in taipei and when the weather for the gondola isn't great



the admission to the zoo is only ntw$60
it's an incredibly cheap day out for such an amazing zoo! taipei zoo also has 2 pandas, koalas, giraffes and many more animals
a highly recommended great day out



the taipei zoo is not a world class facility
but it is a nice zoo with a fairly substantial number of species and, of course, it has pandas
frankly, the pandas are the big draw, and for good reason
they were quite active when we were there, and their enclosure is well done
the zoo admission is also very affordable
a trip to the zoo when combined with the maokong gondola makes for a nice day in taipei



its quite easy to get to the zoo via the mrt, and the line to get in was not long at all
the entry price is very cheap
there is quite a bit of walking to do, and a good amount of animals and displays to see, i was surprised how much there was to see and do
definately worth a visit if you have a spare day to sight see



unfortunately it rained throughout our visit so we saw only a few miserable animals
however, admission tickets are very cheap and we wanted mainly to see the pandas
we were not disappointed
it was the right time (10-11am) to see them up close, feeding - the food was placed near the glass window barrier



this was a surprise--really an extensive animal collection and a great bargain, with adult entry tickets only 60nt dollars
you could easily spend most of a day seeing the entire zoo
easily accessible by the mrt



liked- pretty complete set of animals to see
disliked- the distance between the zoo animals are pretty far and the paved floors are in need of maintenance



they have a whole house for the pandas, but it's really just the first floor
the park itself is a good walk and widely spread out on a hill, so most people start with taking the shuttle to the top and working their way down
for the price (about 60 ntd, and you can pay with your easy card), it is a fun way to spend a day or a half day, then take the maokong gondola (can also pay for the maokung gondola with easy card)



there was nothing outstanding about this zoo for me, its a nice enough place to take a wander around if you have a spare few hours
we were hoping to take in the gondala too while we were there but it was closed when we visited
most of the animals seem happy enough but there were a few exhibits that to be frank i was disgusted in
the rats were crammed in to a space that wasn't big enough for one, the elephants and bears were showing signs of stress with repetitve behaviours and the sloths were crammed into a tiny space too
don't put it too high on your agenda for taipei 



well organized animal halls and natural environment located at the corner of taipei city
good to bring some water and sandwiches to have some walk and picnic on the way
you won't get bored if you stay all day there!


we spent a day at taipei zoo
wide variety and a day is not enough


great value, very educational, lots of animals, was surprised this was not rated higher
our family including our preschooler enjoyed it very much
one tip is if u have very young children or want a shorter trip, take the zoo train to the top of the hill then work downhill towards the entrance
we went on a slight rainy day and avoided the crowds at the panda enclosure



the zoo is very big - nice to relax as it is just like a park
very limited animal exhibits and there are no animal shows
it is conveniently located next to the mrt station
do go if you have time



for twd60, we were expecting some run down zoo, but this is a superb zoo
lots of eateries throughout the zoo, rest/picnic areas
animals all looked healthy and happy
if you think singapore zoo is fantastic, wait till you see the taipei zoo
we got to see the koalas, penguins, panda bear, all which were not available here



it is a huge place
do take the train ride up the hill (nt5) and walk down to visit the exhibits
i like the zebra & the giraffe exhibits
didn't manage to finish all as i walked up the hill & ended up taking the train at the top of the hill (near the penguin exhibit) down near to the main entrance
i thought the food within the zoo was great
alot of options
even had 50lan bubble tea & i had my 'pig intestine mian xian' there too
try not to go on a sun if you can help it
else go extremely early and leave
the whole place was extremely crowded by about 3pm when we tried to leave



there is much to see of course but its very quiet
not much activities going on
it can be quite a walk too



do not usually do a zoo visit while on holiday but it has been so many years since i saw pandas i made the effort and i am glad i did 
the zoo is very well set out - be sure to get a map on entry - as usual most of the animals are sleeping , it is an extensive place so wear comfy shoes , there is a bus available to get you around should you need it and there are plenty of food outlets , the panda exhibit was not what i had hoped for but the rest of the zoo made for a good day out , we went on the gondola -out of the zoo turn left - afterwards and saw the zoo from above , good family day out 



it has definitely since that last time i went (maybe 10 years ago)
the smell is hardly noticeable
heaps of animals
need to allocate a whole day
theres a train system within the zoo that takes you to different sections if your legs need a rest
there are also interactive activities and interesting information about the animals all throughout the zoo
i was particularly fond of the section about what happens to all the animal poo~ also lots of fake animals for you to pose with
heaps of food and drink stations for your convenience
although the toilets werent immaculate, they were tolerable
think someone goes around the whole day cleaning them so depends on your luck whether you go straight after cleaning or just before cleaning i suppose
also heaps of really cute souvenirs to take memories of fluffy zoo animals back home with you
was rather disappointed that the pandas had the day off when i went
first monday of every month
will remember for next time~


wanted to see the pandas which were indeed well displayed but the whole thing reminds me why i do not like the idea of zoos locking animals up



i was really surprised at this zoo
first it costs only 60 ntd to get in (about $2 u
s)
then this zoo i incredibly clean and huge
we walked the whole zoo and it took us about 4 hours or so to see everything
the zoo is split up in to a bunch of different sections each with its own theme and restaurants
we walked the whole thing which took us 4 hours but there is a train that takes you around the zoo
every animal i could think of was here at the zoo
lions, bears, elephants, hippos, beavers, even penguins
there is also a reptile house for those who likes to see snakes, frogs, turtles and stuff like that
we went to the zoo just to kill time but we were pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of this zoo
with such cheap admission price, everyone should definitely check it out



i dont usually go to zoos alot as ive seen wildlife in east africa
but this is probably the best zoo ive seen so far with alot of animals
i was more interested in the cable cart that takes u up to the peak, the weather and atmosphere is delighting up there



close to the gondola, lots of animals, nice shops and cute and super popular pandas
much nicer than for example the beijing zoo



the zoo has a lot of interesting animals like the giant panda, red panda, etc
it has a nice insectarium with lots of live butterflies and other fling insects
since the zoo is quite big, you may get tired of walking around it
the atmosphere is very good though, you'd feel like you're in a mountain hiking trail on the way back
it's best to go in the morning so you can see all of the animals
the zoo has nice services
you can rent strollers near the information and there are locker rooms available
some things worth noting: the zoo entrance fee is very cheap and you should eat at a restaurant called ireland's potato
their honey mustard potato is godly!


our kids love animals, and we identify gorilla, camel and pandas as unique for us
taipei zoo is hugh, and we will recommend you take a tram up, and walk downwards

htmlactually, maokong gondola is more exciting than taipei zoo :)http://sengkangbabies

html


it is supposed to be the largest zoo in asia
the animals look unhappy and the facilities are poor
the animals are in confining cement pens that are reminiscent of the old u
s
zoos
the entry fee is low - $2 usd



mrt station: taipei zoofee: nt$40 (buy 1, take 1 - what a deal!)so the three of us only spent nt$20 each for the zoo
taipei zoo reminds me of singapore zoo where animals are kept in large habitats
the only difference is taipei zoo does not offer shows, and waaaaay cheaper than sg zoo's sg$20 (approx
us$16
50) entrance fee
we rode the tram that cost nt$5 per person to go to the bird park, farthest part, and then we walked our way back to see the animals
and then we rode the maokong gondola
inside the taipei zoo can be found the gondola taipei zoo station where you can ride the gondola that will pass over the lush tea plantations and will give you a nice bird's eye view of the hills towards the south of taipei
i loved this because it is just like the mrt which will bring you to different stations, just hanging and with a lot better view and excitement

i've been to taipei 3 times and went to the zoo each time
my most recent visit in april 2011 i went on a weekday and for some reason the panda exhibit was closed
for the price you really can't beat this zoo, they have so many animals and exhibits
make sure to bring a hat or umbrella, lots of walking in the sun



i live in the nyc area, so the bronx zoo is my local zoo
my family visits zoos wherever we travel
don't miss this zoo! the exhibits are large, natural habitats, so the animals seem really content
although we visited in the miserable august heat and humidity, there was almost no animal stink! they must keep it really clean!! although the two pandas are the star exhibit, i found the exhibit for indiginous animals more interesting
taiwanese boars, taiwanese black bears and pangolins are not exhibited in the us
the number and variety of lorises was also noteworthy
the zoo is quite large, so plan to spend at least 2 hours
the maokong gondola is nearby, so you can make a long day of it by including visits to the tea plantations



we visited the taipei zoo on the last weekend of october 2010
 before taiwan, we lived in cincinnati, oh, which has an excellent zoo where we were regular members
the taipei zoo was very comparable to the cincinnati zoo - right down to the extreme hills! bring your good walking shoes for this place as you will be climbing up a mountain as you visit the various exhibits
seeing the panda was awesome, though they do shuffle you through and discourage lingering
the animals are typical of most zoos
food prices are above street price in taipei, but less than american mark-ups at amusement places
entrance price is fabulously low
facilities are well kept for a very public space in taipei
although we don't quite understand all the guinea pig and hamster exhibits, we enjoyed our trip to the taipei zoo and will return



this is a bad experience for my child in taipei zoo
she has lost her wallet with her student pass
the security and police are very unfriendly to help to search
before we return to our home, we have been calling the zoo to check the status, the centre sound very impatient to us



i found this zoo underwhelming
there is nothing wrong with it, really, but i expected a lot more after reading so many stellar reviews on this site
you see the pandas on a limited time frame, and are shuffled along
they are behind glass with florescent lighting
that's the entire reason we went
if you live in taiwan, by all means make a day trip
if you are on a limited schedule, skip the zoo and go to maokong for tea



i personally love the zoo =) cos the animals look rather well-cared ( fat and chubby not like the ones in my country) there are 8 outdoor and indoor areas each
my fave is the giant panda house, penguin house and of course the nocturnal animal house
if you visit during summer, the opening hours are prolonged to 9pm where you can enjoy the sight of nocturnal animal activities as well
the ticket price is really cheap!! currently the zoo is having this promotion where you pay only nst60 for 2 persons
same goes to maokong gondola nst150 for 2persons
(usual price nst60 and nst150 for each person respectively)i would suggest that you take the cable car from maokong gondola if you're running on a tight schedule all the way up to sanxuan temple, enjoy the view for a bit before coming down and make a stop and spend the rest of the evening at the taipei zoo stop, (taipei zoo stop outside of the zoo or south taipei zoo where it stops inside the zoo near bird world area) avoid visiting on mondays as certain animal house is closed alternately
(check the website to avoid disappointment)
baby strollers & lockers are provided at a small fee



just a few steps beside the mrt station, dont worry about getting lost
once you reach the station, will start taking photos with all the cute wallpaper until exit~ was kinda sad as the period i went the maokong gondola under maintenance before their school holidays! mcdonalds located on left side once you exit from mrt station
a number of vending machines, mini marts, rest point, toilets and water dispensers in the zoo so no worries too
just bring a empty bottle, umbrella/hat and maybe a hand fan? the landscape of the zoo itself really beautiful

taipei zoo is the largest zoo in asia
it is located in the district of muzha
you can take the mrt and very convinience to go
nice place to go with your families



taipei zoo is located next to a mrt station, and the whole area is surrouned by green moutains, thus the air quality is undoutedly good
to enter the zoo, you have to purchase a ticket at the main entrance and it's strongly suggessted that you wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because to walk around the entire zoo can be really tiring
don't forget to grab a map as well(if you don't where to get one, just ask the ticket conductor)
if you are not in a hurry, try to schedule a whole morning or afternoon so that you won't miss anything in the zoo
it can be relaxing spending a pretty long time just walking around in the zoo and taking some pictures
i personally recommend the penguin house, the zebra park and the panda house the most, but i don't meam other animals can be ignored
reversely, everything is worth seeing! seriously everything!! i noticed there are two dining sections, one is near the zebra park and the other is on the other side of the panda house(near the entrance)
the zoo accommondates animals from different continents, you can see grizzy bears from north america, monkeys from madagascar, and tigers from central asia and more
just take your time and get ready for a "zoo odyssey"!


we had an enjoyable visit to the zoo with the highlight being the 2 panda bears
overall it is an average zoo with good section devoted to local animals
it would have to be one of the cheapest zoos in the world with entry cost being 60 ntd
it is easy to get to as the mrt goes directly there
do the zoo and the nearby makokong gondola and you will have a great day out in taipei



for me, it is the best zoo i've been to
it is well kept, very clean and i appreciate the effort of the landscaping
the entrance is just 60ntd
my son, who is only 5 yrs old, is free
renting a wheelchair is free too
like most places in taiwan, service was good
my son had a wonderful time
we liked the place so much
i've been to this place 1995, and i was pleasantly surprised of its improvement



this is not the best zoo i have seen
it said to be big, but finished the zoo in 3 hours - that included pit stops
many of the exhibits seemed run down, and not well maintained
but i can see the intention in their design but somehow didn't pull through
would i visit the zoo again? probably not



we ended up at the taipei zoo by chance
had originally planned to go to maokong gondola but it was closed
so we walked over to the taipei zoo and it was priced at 60ntd for adults and 30 ntd for kids
(i have 10 yr old boy and 7 yr old girl)
at that kinda price, we thought what the heck, let's just go in since we're anyway already here
the zoo initially starts off with some modest exhibits
however as you walk deeper into the zoo you start to discover lots of very well kept enclosures in a very well laid out zoo
walkways and footpaths are all very wide and rarely did we feel it was over crowded, even though there were a few local schools that brought their students in
overall we were very impressed with the zoo, and both my kids were singing praises on the zoo
we left the zoo barely 2 mins to closing, and yet did not finish all the exhibits



from cheap vending machines to an air gondola up the hill to clean (by taiwanese standards) bathrooms, the taipei zoo does a really nice job of making visitors comfortable
the signs within the zoo are largely accessible to visitors reading chinese and english (and even phonetic chinese, so learners can sound out the animal names)
the animals aren't anything too out of the ordinary (2 types of elephants, turtles, pandas, large cats, penguins) except for their tremendous collection of primates
we consider it a "must see" for each visit to taipei



the zoo has a large collection of animals, birds, insects and plants
it is clean, has cheap entry ticket, vending machines and stalls are not overpriced unlike many other zoos of the world
we were glad to visit it on a weekday: missed the crowd
the zoo particularly lacks trainers, interactive shows, which makes visit to any zoo particularly exciting
my two kids (age 11 and 4) were glad to visit the zoo but would not like to do it again
fyi: they have visited the singapore bird park + zoological garden a few times and would like to do that again (and again)



the zoo was sweet
there were pandas, giraffes, bison, elephants, penguins, snakes, frogs, turtles, cougars, bears, and lots more
we went on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded at all
there were air-conditioned rooms, and shade from the trees, so it wasn't too hot
however, we only had a few hours, so we didn't get to see all the animals
i went with my mom who is 60, and my grandma who is in her 80s
there is an area where you can rent wheelchairs
it was free for my grandma since she is a citizen
i highly recommend that you take the little tram up to the bird wildlife section, so you don't have to walk uphill
it's 5nt per person
then you can walk down and see the different exhibits along the way
admission is only 60nt (which is $2 usd)
you can get there very easily by mrt, by taking the muzha line
what a great deal :)


taipei zoo is a wonderful place to get away from everything and just enjoy a nice stroll and look at the animals
the panda house was a bit of a disappointment though
as you go into the zoo they hand you a ticket with a time on it - that is the time you can go and visit the pandas
i made my way there, gave my ticket and went in
there are two "rooms" for the pandas with a little opening for them to go between the two
when i arrived they were in the furthest room
just as i got my camera out the pandas decided to go through to the other room
i followed them and was shouted at in chinese by the guards - that was it, you cannot go back, i had my time!! i was extremely disgruntled by this (considering the pandas were the only reason for my visit to the zoo)
i marched around to the front entrance again and asked if i could go in again
i think it helped being a foreigner as they thought i was weird and let me in again
this time i got to enjoy the pandas for a little bit more (only about 2 minutes though)
so be warned, you might not get that long a time with the pandas
the rest of the zoo was lovely, but i was there in july and it was extremely hot and humid
take an umbrella as it's bound to rain and plenty of water
a great place though i would thoroughly recommend it



taipei zoo is laid out very well; good range of animals including lots of large ones (indian and african elephants, rhino, hippotami) as well as monkeys and a fairly large nocturnal house
this has the time at 12 hours behind the outside world, so you get to see the animals during their nighttime
however, this isn't the nicest of environments - especially for the cats, which were pacing up and down and looking rather bored when we visited
the enclosures otherwise were large and with a good spread of vegetation
it is a large zoo, and the whole thing entails a lot of walking up hill
i'd recommend you don't do what we did, which was to start at the bottom; take the shuttle train to the top and then walk down



i was impressed with the size and landscape of this zoo
it is very green and lush
i've been to all the zoos in southern california and this zoo has a better landscape than all of them (yes, even the san diego zoo)
i'm aware that the climate is a contributing factor
they have some nice exhibits, such as the zebra or hippo exhibits
they don't have as many animals as other zoos, but they make up for it in exhibit size and the size of the zoo
prepare to do some walking
a plus is the surrounding area! just look around the zoo an you will see that you are surrounded by green mountains
really, a beautiful place and it is accessible by the mrt
bonus! the only thing i did not like was the penguin exhibit


a bit cheesy and it did not fit the grandness of this place
also, i was not familiar with the low toilet bowls in the restroom
i hear these "squat" type toilets are popular in taiwan



we arrived late but had about three hours to enjoy this wonderful zoo
really combines the zoo with a vast garden
the zoo starts at the bottom of a slope and climbs to the top about two kilometers later
usual zoo fare but exceptional areas include the taiwan species area and the penguin compound at the top of the zoo
lots of fun for families and especially kids
most signs include some english
local foods at the snack bars as well as fast food hamburgers and fries
a cute train runs top to bottom with several stops
for twd 60 and 30 for kids this has to be the super bargain of the city
you could easily spend most of the morning and afternoon in the zoo then walk over late afternoon (after the crowds are gone) to the gondola that runs up the mountain (catch the late afternoon views and come back in the dark; fabulous)
from the zoo train station (the last stop) go left to the zoo or right to the gondola ride 
enjoy
